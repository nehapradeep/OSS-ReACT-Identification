"","","Apache Kvrocks is a distributed key value NoSQL database that uses RocksDB as storage engine and is compatible with Redis protocol. Kvrocks intends to decrease the cost of memory and increase the capacity while compared to Redis. The design of replication and storage was inspired by rocksplicator and blackwidow."
"","","Kvrocks has the following key features: Redis Compatible: Users can access Apache Kvrocks via any Redis client. Namespace: Similar to Redis SELECT but equipped with token per namespace. Replication: Async replication using binlog like MySQL. High Availability: Support Redis sentinel to failover when master or slave was failed. Cluster: Centralized management but accessible via any Redis cluster client."
"2","Who uses Kvrocks","You can find Kvrocks users at the Users page. Users are encouraged to add themselves to the Users page. Either leave a comment on the ""Who is using Kvrocks"" issue, or directly send a pull request to add company or organization information and logo."
"2","Build and run Kvrocks",""
"3","Prerequisite","Ubuntu / Debian: sudo apt update; sudo apt install -y git build-essential cmake libtool python3 libssl-dev"
"","","CentOS / RedHat: sudo yum install -y centos-release-scl-rh; sudo yum install -y git devtoolset-11 autoconf automake libtool libstdc++-static python3 openssl-devel"
"","","Download and install cmake via https://cmake.org/download: wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.26.4/cmake-3.26.4-linux-x86_64.sh -O cmake.sh; sudo bash cmake.sh --skip-license --prefix=/usr"
"","","Enable gcc and make in devtoolset-11: source /opt/rh/devtoolset-11/enable"
"","","openSUSE / SUSE Linux Enterprise: sudo zypper install -y gcc11 gcc11-c++ make wget git autoconf automake python3 curl cmake"
"","","Arch Linux: sudo pacman -Sy --noconfirm autoconf automake python3 git wget which cmake make gcc"
"","","macOS: brew install git cmake autoconf automake libtool openssl; brew link --force openssl"
"3","Build","It is as simple as: git clone https://github.com/apache/kvrocks.git; cd kvrocks; ./x.py build"
"","","To build with TLS support: ./x.py build -DENABLE_OPENSSL=ON"
"","","To build with lua instead of luaJIT: ./x.py build -DENABLE_LUAJIT=OFF"
"","","Build with debug mode: ./x.py build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug"
"3","Running Kvrocks","./build/kvrocks -c kvrocks.conf"
"3","Running Kvrocks using Docker","docker run -it -p 6666:6666 apache/kvrocks --bind 0.0.0.0"
"","","Or get the nightly image: docker run -it -p 6666:6666 apache/kvrocks:nightly"
"3","Connect Kvrocks service","redis-cli -p 6666"
"3","Running test cases","./x.py build --unittest; ./x.py test cpp; ./x.py test go"
"3","Supported platforms","Linux, macOS"
"2","Namespace","Namespace is used to isolate data between users. Unlike all the Redis databases can be visited by requirepass, we use one token per namespace. requirepass is regraded as admin token, and only admin token allows to access the namespace command, as well as some commands like config, slaveof, bgsave, etc."
"2","Cluster","Kvrocks implements a proxyless centralized cluster solution but its accessing method is completely compatible with the Redis cluster client. You can use Redis cluster SDKs to access the kvrocks cluster."
"2","Documents","Documents are hosted at the official website. Supported Commands, Design Complex Structure on RocksDB, Replication Design"
"2","Tools","To manage Kvrocks clusters for failover, scaling up/down and more, use kvrocks-controller. To export the Kvrocks monitor metrics, use kvrocks_exporter. To migrate from Redis to Kvrocks, use RedisShake. To migrate from Kvrocks to Redis, use kvrocks2redis built via ./x.py build"
