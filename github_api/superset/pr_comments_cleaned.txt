Superset uses Git pre-commit hooks courtesy of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). To install run the following:\r\n```\r\npip3 install -r requirements/development.txt\r\npre-commit install\r\nA series of checks will now run when you make a git commit.\r\n```\r\nAlternatively it is possible to run pre-commit by running pre-commit manually:\r\n```\r\npre-commit run --all-files\r\n``` \r\nThat should fix up the pre-commit job on CI :)

Here, added --fix -> https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/32596/commits/ac7fd7e42e22351b5823dee4f31494931cce7cb4

Ok removed the last `SKIP_FIX`  reference that was there for the docs I think. `pre-commit` now always tries to fix what it can, which I think is what everyone wants all the time.

Hello, thanks for the suggestion! Can you explain why someone would want to use that `-h` flag, so that readers know?

I think you can just use the `no-restricted-imports` feature if you want to keep it simpler.

I am restarting failed jobs, hopefully that was a flaky one

At a glance, this looks good to me. Just needs a code owner review from @betodealmeida, @eschutho, @michael-s-molina, and/or @mistercrunch.

Thanks @eschutho for taking a look. I had a similar approach to use a feature flag [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/29335) but it was suggested using the modal would be a better approach so it was not a global setting

Thanks for the PR @Dev10-34. Could you instead of adding a checkbox to enabling black borders, add a control to set the border color which by default is transparent (no border)? This is important as the color border may conflict with the color scheme used by the chart.

I added a function in utils.ts which lets you change the opacity as well now\r\n

I applied all the suggestions which you gave, however, upon re running there seems to be a bug sorta where even though the border width is set to 0 as default, on initial creation of the chart. If you move the border width slider, it fixes itself. Everything else works as intended functionally, just the visuals of the initial chart creation shows the borders as well, even if all the defaults are set correctly.\r\nGiving borderWidth variable in transformProps.ts an initial value as 0 seems to fix this issue

Oh, actually, the test failures seem relevant. Would you be willing to take a look at the event triggers there and see if you can get things to pass? You can run the single test from the `superset-frontend` directory via `npm run test src/dashboard/components/gridComponents/Markdown.test.jsx`

Sure I am looking into it.

For some reason i am not able to run test locally, can you check this request, otherwise I will find solution for running test locally.

Yep I just approved test runs. I have had trouble getting my local environment set up too so I get it!

@sfirke why this one test is failing i do not understand, or is there any docs for running test locally?

@rusackas this is now passing CI, could you take a look when you get a chance?

hey @sfirke now you can check I have done a all nighter to fix it.

@hainenber please help me run a CI again，thanks a lot

Could you please help me agree and check the code online? Thank you

CI has already run. I’ll be reviewing your code.

I found that the code for table preview has been greatly adjusted, which is exactly where I fixed it. The interface calls are different from what I modified before, and the only thing fixed is the improvement. It is suggested to slow down the improvement of this section of code, as there are indeed many bugs and bug fixes cannot keep up with the speed of improving the code. This is not reasonable, and it is more appropriate to prioritize bug fixes in the code.

@hainenber I have adjusted the code. Thank you for agreeing to run the constantly blocked reviews。\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45dfb57f-a3e5-4f6b-9e87-952ad55cec3c)\r\n

Thank you so much for giving DASHBOARD_RBAC this love!\r\n\r\nIt possible, can this please be tested (or otherwise checked) to tell if the change also resolves the special case that "a dataset included in a dataset as a subquery using the built-in `dataset()` Jinja macro does not get granted DASHBOARD_RBAC based accessibility even though such access is expected", as commented on previously at?: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/31938#issuecomment-2635204648\r\n\r\n(I looked through the file changes, and was not entirely certain if such DASHBOARD_RBAC-based nested/Jinja-included dataset accessibility is already fixed in this change -- to me, it looked like "maybe?").

Just tested this against 5.0.0-rc1, and it seems to work. Dashboard RBAC previously came up with all the permission warnings when trying to open one.\r\n\r\nNote: just a first time user of Superset, not a review!

If these permissions are required, it would be a good idea to use the `fix` prefix for this PR so it can be cherry-picked into 5.0.

Hi! I am Kasia and I am UX/UI designer contributing to Superset and working in Preset. \r\n\r\nIn this case caret is an action trigger/button. I agree with AI response to the PR, that these are patterns that are widely used in UX and intuitive for the general audience. The same pattern is used across the app in selects, dropdown triggers or similar collapsible sections (not including legacy components): \r\n<img width="607" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9442e746-4757-4ab3-adca-70e695ee2c34" />\r\n<img width="488" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e93c3ee-a1fb-4c24-bc9e-ba904e496ee0" />\r\nSo I would argue that the current implementation is the pattern that we should go with. \r\n

re-running CI 🤞 

Thanks for staying on top of this! Re-running CI 🤞 

@sadpandajoe yes we do in CI, but this add the checks to `pre-commit` so issues can be caught at commit time, which is better. This adds in a fair amount of complexity to deliver on it. \r\n\r\nWondering if it would make sense to only do it on superset-frontend/**/js-and-ts-files to keep pre-commit.yml a bit simpler.\r\n\r\n@alveifbklsiu259  is it all super fast?

Normally we use dotted or dashed for a time shift line, would this be confusing for the user if they used this for the regular line?

By defaut, there isnt any enforcement for overriding line style. People with intention will configure it by themselves so no changes to previous behavior.

I think @sadpandajoe is concerned that if a user picks dashed for the main series, then time shift is also dotted, with no means to change it. This would indeed be confusing. If there could be a (conditionally rendered) control to pick the line style for time shift lines, that would be a win in my book!

Bump for posterity 😄 \n\nI notice that quite a few folks raising issue related to this change in Slack.

Convert to Draft as there are more breakages than expected

Close as unused deps turned out to be used discreetly.

@michael-s-molina we should probably cherry this since there are a few changes which might come back as the build being broken.

ah right, the `shortid` var assignment is to initialize the ShortId client 🤦 . Thanks for catching this, Michael! I owed Korbit an apology.

@mistercrunch can you elaborate? The initial shortid implementation is randomly generated as well. Something I miss in the grand scheme?

Makes sense @mistercrunch!

Looks like esbuild is no longer updatable, so this is no longer needed.

I was unable to post the issues I found. This could be because a force push or squash has changed the commit history since I scanned this pull request. You can get another review by commenting `/korbit-review`.

Really appreciate your contribution! The frontend-generated screenshots weren’t working well for me, so I needed backend-generated ones to tweak the WebDriver settings as needed. This fix made it possible.\r\nthanks a lot! 🙏🏻

afraid to look at coverage before/after... whatever happened to covecov?!

There are 4 Enzyme tests I have converted to RTL in this [PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/31634). Might be a tad better than to delete them away? :D

@mistercrunch I think the difference between Enzyme tests and Cypress tests are:\r\n- There are active efforts regarding converting Enzyme to RTL.\r\n- The level of flakiness during CI runs is very different.\r\n- We capture more regressions with Enzyme tests than Cypress tests.\r\n\r\nThe radical approach might be more appropriate for Cypress tests.

Thank you @ChrisChinchilla !

I think that CI failure is just a flaky test? If someone confirms, we can merge.

Tried to rebase to address a flaky CI failure and spammed everyone, sorry

@villebro I fixed the rebase and the flaky test finally passed, I believe this is ready for merge but needs your approval

Opened by mistake :(

@mistercrunch I almost clicked the merge button here, but held off — do you see that audit as a blocker for this?

Not a blocker, merged!

@michael-s-molina would be good if we can cherry this in also for part of 5.0rc2

@alexandrusoare Thanks for your comments! We have decided to set up a default color for the icons. \r\n\r\nThese icons probably don’t have the assigned colors.\r\n\r\nWhen I’ve finished the remaining work, I’ll take a look at it. Thanks!

It also looks like the icons are not centered vertically in the new version

\r\n> It also looks like the icons are not centered vertically in the new version\r\n\r\nHi, thanks for your review, I recently changed the structure of the icon component. Previously, the icons were centered using line-height, but after modifying the structure, that no longer worked. I just released a fix that should resolve this issue. Could you check again please?

Thank yo so much @EnxDev ❤️ \r\n\r\nA few things I found so far \r\n\r\n\r\n- Action icons in CRUD views are 24x24px and should be 16x16px for a more balanced look (for example favorites star is 16x16)\r\n<img width="1293" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/985f6da1-ce01-4f2b-a350-a28d8bfaa18f" />\r\n\r\n\r\n- Icons in buttons should be bigger (10px is not really visible), I can see in ant-d they are 14x14px and we can follow that for keeping our implementation pretty much vanilla without lots of deviations. I can see that on master we use in here some weird size like 10x12, but the previous icon was much more bold, so it needs to be bigger. NOTE: I found that in some buttons we use 16px (for example save button in explore), so not sure what the rule is. Is this the correct time to update it? @EnxDev @geido \r\n<img width="373" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84a96c95-8fb1-4628-8d57-0ca9c8a57d54" />\r\n\r\n- might be old implementation, but this icon should match other button icons like mentioned above (14px)\r\n<img width="335" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15aaac66-3428-4975-b396-b039a7359f9d" />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- For somer reasons in the navbar spacings between caret-down and text/icons disappeared.

I can see that on master we use in here some weird size like 10x12, but the previous icon was much more bold, so it needs to be bigger. NOTE: I found that in some buttons we use 16px (for example save button in explore), so not sure what the rule is.

Raised issue, No input validations there on UI #31723 -> which is closed by rusackas and has been moved to discussion No input validations there on UI #31772.

@chakilamsuryat so what happens to any dashboard/chart now that has characters that are no longer allowed? Will they break when a user tries to save?

@sadpandajoe , if given input invalid characters as shared in screenshot, it will give popup of error messaging saying that its not allowed and that name will not save.

@rusackas ,  Improper Input Validation- It is observed that application fails to validate and sanitize user supplied input containing malicious JavaScript which may be executed on browser leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting.

> So I say: rip out all deps and tests that cause headaches with React 17.\r\n\r\nI pulled this PR and executed the unit tests to collect some insights to help with this discussion:\r\n- We currently have `178/4545` tests failing (`~4%`)\r\n- Not all errors are related to Enzyme, we have many RTL tests failing. Some examples: `DatasourceEditor.test.jsx`, `SavedQuerylist.test.jsx`, `DatasourceControl.test.tsx`, `AlertReportModal.test.tsx`, `FilterBart.test.tsx`.\r\n\r\nGiven the low percentage of failing tests, IF we are able to resolve the problems with RTL tests, I would be OK with skipping failed Enzyme tests in favor of upgrading React.\r\n

Any patterns identified in the failing, non-enzyme tests?

Personally I support `it.skip` on enzyme test for the sake of moving forward, and take a note to either translate/rewrite/delete based on a case by case basis.

I was unable to post the issues I found. This could be because a force push or squash has changed the commit history since I scanned this pull request. You can get another review by commenting `/korbit-review`.

@mistercrunch this PR should hopefully fix that flaky E2E test that you have skipped in this PR https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/31933. Feel free to rebase and unskip it if my PR passes CI.

Re-bump :D

> Oof! LGTM. I wish we had unit tests for this logic.\r\n\r\nOne thing I want to do is write a CI action that checks if the return value of cached functions has changed, and warns in the PR that the cache needs to be purged. We could also make it check if all arguments are used in the cache key.

Might be a feature, but would be good to have a checkbox on imports that ask if the user wants to overwrite. Would also fix workflows where we want to know if things should be overwritten or not.

I agree this should be optional, like a checkbox in the import dialog to "Also overwrite dependencies" or etc, defaulted to un-checked. \r\n\r\nOverwriting all dependencies is currently already possible via the `/api/v1/assets/import/` endpoint, but having this as a new feature via the UI is definitely helpful! 🙌

@michael-s-molina is there anything else that needs to be addressed, or is this good to go, assuming the async task type change can wait until the GATF feature?

Can you reference the PR number/link in the description, and elaborate on exactly what impacts this might have? I just get paranoid about touching anything with timezones :) 

Thanks! This has been superseded by https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/31941

merging henry_test branch

Thanks!\n\nRe:CI, I think the 5th E2E test got borked after merging #31796

Probably just a flaky test, rerunning

I checked e2e CI history. They all failed at 5th shard 🤔 

The e2e test should be fixed now with https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/31933. Should just need a rebase.

sheesh, rebase sheenanigans! Fixing in progress. Sorry for all folks getting notified!

Yeah, the e2e experience isnt the greatest right now… @geido @mistercrunch the Annotations „Create formula annotation y-axis goal line” is yet another test that’s been frequently failing for years. Would be great if one of us could take a look at that as a part of cypress cleanup project. 

Hey I don\

@mistercrunch We can hold off on this pr until #31858 is merged. I can rebase this onto your changes after.

Sorry for the pings people, was trying to solve merge conflicts.

Looks great, once Justin’s comment is addressed it’s good to merge

Looks like everything discussed is in order. Thanks for the contribution!

The PR is missing unit tests. It would be great to add them in a follow-up PR. Thanks for your contribution @fardin-developer !

Wrong repo 

@sadpandajoe maybe we can pair up and dig in, I have the whole interactive Cypress thing running and interactively debugging but was stuck. Also confused as to how my backend PR creates tooltip/modal issues. Seem like timing / race condition type stuff. Tried disabling animation, longer timeouts, ...

@eschutho you probably have an env var in our current shell pointing to 8088. \r\n```\r\n$ env | grep -i cypress\r\n$ unset CYPRESS_BASE_URL\r\n```

@rusackas I think the tests should pass now

meant for my fork... sorry.

You need to run the pre-commit hook to pass CI.\r\n\r\nSuperset uses Git pre-commit hooks courtesy of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). To install run the following:\r\n```\r\npip3 install -r requirements/development.txt\r\npre-commit install\r\nA series of checks will now run when you make a git commit.\r\n```\r\nAlternatively it is possible to run pre-commit by running pre-commit manually:\r\n```\r\npre-commit run --all-files\r\n``` 

@villebro thank you for your feedback. I removed the i18n part and will add it in a new PR.\r\n\r\nI also added tests for the time grain part to ensure that it works as expected.

@jpchev do you mean to see what the rules are? There are various eslint.config.js files in the codebase you can look at. \r\n\r\nIf you mean you want to _run_ the script to test it, you can check the `package.json` file for all the npm scripts, but the one you probably want is `npm run lint-fix`

Ooops approved twice...

In our app, to upgrade Pandas to 2.2.3 and still work with SQLAlchemy 1.4.x, we had to change the way we called e.g. `pd.read_sql_query` \r\n\r\nSo, the likes of this call: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/aae8fda11dafdd96298884962e790d10bd0104d0/superset/models/helpers.py#L1381\r\n\r\nWould change to read:\r\n```\r\ndf = pd.read_sql_query(sql=sql, con=engine.raw_connection())\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorth a try in the places it fails 👍

@nicholaslimck

@villebro might be most qualified to look at this one, if he has time. That said, there are some failing tests that could use attention, and a more descritive PR title could help too :D 

@pomegranited all checks pass now

all tests pass now,\r\nbut due to a merge conflict I had to remove all my commits and push again, \r\nand that closed the PR, so I had to reopen again and that requires again your approval.\r\n\r\n@villebro @michael-s-molina could you please have a look if it is ok?\r\n\r\nThank you

@pomegranited do you have news? It seems this PR can be merged, all tests pass and we fixed all the detected issues

Making the service wait for superset-init makes it super clear that example load/reload is slow. Looking to do some work on making example reload super fast, meaning if you already loaded up the examples, upserting them should be extremely quick.

@alexandrusoare would it be a good idea to make the inputs optional? Especially in horizontal filter bar orientation the added inputs may be problematic.

Reviewers: this PR just left draft state.

I am still seeing a bunch of different issues:\r\n\r\n- When selecting the Single value option the filter goes out of scope for some reasons\r\n- When working with the default value I see the value being reset to zero and sometimes I have also seen it blink from the lowest value to the highest, not sure\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/705c8a98-02f1-45c5-8192-ae4e570cde9b

I was hoping someone more FABtastic than me would come along to review this. If not @dpgaspar, perhaps @mistercrunch can take a look.

@rusackas I noticed that the loader is not handled properly in an embedding context. The image does not load. Do you have any idea what might be causing this issue? I came across a topic that could potentially relate to my problem, but the lines referenced in config.py no longer seem relevant (https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/28112#issuecomment-2062595472) @mistercrunch.

It feels like all this should be included in the theme object eventually.

Ok I pushed by bumping a bunch of libraries here, and ultimately got to a place where `next` hung on `setup-backend` while installing python deps. Turns out there were no wheels out for pandas/numpy for the version we had pinned. So I bumped it beyond the range that was specified in our `pyproject.toml` (there was no note around why it had an upper bound) and uncovered some other issue we have with this newer version `pandas`.\r\n\r\nCertainly a good thing to unpin and push through, but might require some work or waiting for newer version of libs to move forward.

@mistercrunch Could you please add the changes made in this PR to `UPDATING.md`?

Done! I think this might be ready for merging

@villebro @michael-s-molina anything else needed to get this merged?

Oops, I forgot to `git push` my commit. I just pushed it

Thanks again for all the sunburst attention! Pinging a couple of subject matter experts :D 

NOTE: this needs to work in forks/without dockerhub creds to be viable

Still on the fence but would require a line in `UPDATING.md` to notify release managers.

@villebro there are roughly two reasons why we parse SQL in Superset:\r\n\r\n1. To extract referenced tables (enforcing data access roles, for example); and\r\n2. To modify the query (enforcing RLS, for example).\r\n\r\nThe feature from this PR falls in category 2. I think that any functionality in that category should always be optional, since there are always security and correctness concerns when modifying a query. So I would propose the following:\r\n\r\n- 5.0: add the feature flag, default to false.\r\n- 6.0: move the feature flag to a configuration option, default to false.

Actually, I think we should have a list of engines in `superset/config.py` where this should be applied, it gives more flexibility.

@betodealmeida would this also push RLS rules to the query predicate as well?

> @betodealmeida would this also push RLS rules to the query predicate as well?\r\n\r\nI think so, but let me double check.

Yeah, the RLS is applied in `get_sqla_query` in `superset/models/helpers.py`, which happens before the query optimization.

@william-fundrecs I assume this PR was mistakenly opened against upstream Superset, not your fork?

@villebro No, this was functionality I thought would be useful to donate back to superset, we already make use of this in our presto Athena DB backed Superset instance.

Can we do it without adding two feature flags, perhaps leaning on config? And do we need to single out S3? Could there be numerous other options for where people get/store their CSV?

This has been updated to remove the S3 download right click context menu option. \r\n\r\nInstead the db type is passed into component props and if feature flag is enabled and db type is athena, the new export functionality will be used, otherwise the existing/default export functionality will be used.\r\n\r\nTo the user it will look exactly the same (aside from vastly faster download speeds when using Athena with query results persisted to S3 bucket)

Looks like this needs a rebase to be mergeable. Thanks for addressing PR comments :D

Pinging @dpgaspar to add more folks who might be interested in a security discussion here. Some might be bothered by the fact that queries can contain PII (like email addresses or names in WHERE clauses) and unlocking these might pose an issue for some deployments/companies.

Tagging @yousoph @geido as you were active on the original issue. Has there has been discussion about making queries shareable via permalinks? Was this considered as a solution? As @rusackas commented, exposing saved queries to anyone with a link to it can be problematic, as per the current design they are private objects. Implementing this is of course more work, but is aligned with how sharing is done in Explore and the Dashboard views.

Implementing this is of course more work, but is aligned with how sharing is done in Explore and the Dashboard views.\r\n\r\nHey, just a clarification.Not anyone with the link can view the query.Any user with public, Gamma, or Alpha roles cannot view the shared saved query link. Access is strictly limited to users who have been explicitly granted permission by the admin under the SQL Lab role. This ensures that only those with appropriate SQL Lab permissions and dataset access are able to load and view the query. All other users, including those with general roles like Gamma or Alpha, will receive an "Access Denied" message when attempting to access the link.

Thanks for the clarification @LevisNgigi 👍

> Hey @LevisNgigi I am a bit confused about the latest changes where it is just showing a newly introduced endpoint. Would you clarify the approach here? Thank you!\r\n\r\nHey @geido This endpoint already existed in the project "/api/v1/query/{pk}". I added custom implementation on the endpoint to add ownership validation to ensure only the query owner or authorized users can access it.Those with "can_read", "SavedQuery" permission. The custom implementation I added addresses this gap,by ensuring that users with sqllab role can view shared query via the url.

Hey @justinpark I made queries shareable via permalink here as well.

@tahvane1 the changes here have linting issues. I suggest installing `pre-commit` hooks to automatically fix these issues.

img2pdf is using GNU Lesser General Public License v3 and it seems that it is not accepted in ASF projects. So need to look for alternative approach then.

Resolution does not fix issue. I can get similar quality by setting quality=100 but this results to a pdf that has double the size what img2pdf produces. I will continue my testings...

FYI I converted this to draft. @tahvane1 please feel free to change it back to non-draft if you find a new ASF-compliant way to fix this issue.

Running CI 🤞 

@rusackas It looks like the icons are vertically misaligned in the screenshot.

I think having the divider designed similarly to the filter can cause confusion.\r\nHow about changing it to make the divider block easily recognizable, rather than using an icon like this?\r\n\r\n![USA_Births_Names](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d06386a0-dc68-4a91-973f-f57ef51a2275)\r\n\r\n

Just noting that there are no icon currently. You could remove the icons and that would make this PR focussed on the trigger.\r\n\r\nIn terms of design, one option could be to `border-bottom` the container div, looking like an underline going across the panel. I would look similar to what it looks like in the dashboard (text with a horizontal bar underneat)

Looks clean @mistercrunch! Two things from me me: \r\n- icons seems big on comparison to the rest of the items in the row - what size is it? \r\n- I like pill for duration, but I think using it for timestamp might be too much - we have so many different items that it can get overwhelming and in other places we just use text for timestamp \r\n\r\nThoughts?

Closing this as #31341 supersedes this PR

@sadpandajoe curious on your thoughts about timing, for context the follow up PR would touch the backend with minor linting tweaks, maybe 300 LoC across the backend.

@michael-s-molina do you still think we should hold back on the 5.0 process or can I just merge?

@birkskyum I am very interested in this temporary solution before fully migrating to MapLibre. Do I understand correctly that once this is merged then I can choose to use maplibre as underneath lib in react-map-gl to display the map and if at the same time I use maptiler tiles service then I am cleanly cut off from the MapBox right?\r\n\r\nI saw this PR is closed, do you know when this can be merged into master?

At the same time, is it possible to build a Superset docker with this upgrade change and use it local for testing purpose?

@AnTapTanhCode, thanks for checking this.

I added a notice to the `config.py` about this, if people are changing the `config.py` file they should be able to handle the token deletion themselves.

Why the heck does this need approval for CI? I was tempted to just click the button, but I figured it might be more helpful to leave it in the "broken" state.

Also the logic in your spec should have some unit tests.

@rusackas I adapted my PR with your recommendations.\r\n\r\n1. I created a geojson and hosted it on my own repo.\r\n2. I updated the Jupyter Notebook project so that it takes my geojson file, based on the same approach as the one used for Philippines.\r\n\r\nI added a step to plot all countries from the "altmaps" in order to preview all maps that are a little more customized. We can see the new France Overseas results right here :).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f58d39f-3d53-4472-ad5d-9533c9696648)\r\n

Found bug with cross-filtering. Converting to draft for now.

Little hint for beginner needed.\r\nBug that I found is not connected with this PR (checked in master & v4.0.1 release).\r\nCan I fix it in this PR or should I fix it in a separate one?

Is user impersonation really needed for OAuth? I would have assumed OAuth mostly makes user impersonation redundant, as you already have full user-specific authentication in place (no need for a service account).

Thanks! Running CI 🤞

### UPDATE: Export Pivot Tables into CSV Format\r\n\r\nIn the last commit, I made a small change to export pivot tables without flattening multi-index rows/columns. This feature, initially implemented by the community for managing JSON export, is particularly unhelpful when dealing with pivot tables exported into CSV format with a large number of columns corresponding to a multi-index.\r\n\r\nTo better explain the issue, I have attached an example. If I create a pivot table with many columns associated with multi-index rows, the flattening process transforms them into a single column with a field value obtained by concatenating all fields separated by a space. This approach is not very effective if we want to use these exports in Excel or other tools.\r\n\r\n##### Example:\r\n\r\nI created this pivot table using your example dataset:\r\n\r\n![pivot_table](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f71798c-36d2-4989-b8e4-1f9cc5f790b7)\r\n\r\nThe AS-IS behavior generates this type of file, where the MultiIndex columns get collapsed into one row and MultiIndex Rows get merged into a single column, obtained by concatenating all fields separated by a space. This export is not very easy to use in Excel for the next steps.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c142d4b3-2a48-4fbf-afe9-15b48121f9a5)\r\n\r\n[export_as_is_20241119_101212.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17814564/export_as_is_20241119_101212.csv)\r\n\r\nThe TO-BE behavior generates this type of file, where the MultiIndex rows/columns get preserved:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7796e2a6-031a-415a-abf5-ed460244bbfb)\r\n\r\n[export_to_be_20241119_100853.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17814637/export_to_be_20241119_100853.csv)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Code Complete\r\n\r\n~~~python\r\ndef apply_post_process(\r\n    result: dict[Any, Any],\r\n    form_data: Optional[dict[str, Any]] = None,\r\n    datasource: Optional[Union["BaseDatasource", "Query"]] = None,\r\n) -> dict[Any, Any]:\r\n    form_data = form_data or {}\r\n\r\n    viz_type = form_data.get("viz_type")\r\n    if viz_type not in post_processors:\r\n        return result\r\n\r\n    post_processor = post_processors[viz_type]\r\n\r\n    for query in result["queries"]:\r\n        if query["result_format"] not in (rf.value for rf in ChartDataResultFormat):\r\n            raise Exception(  # pylint: disable=broad-exception-raised\r\n                f"Result format {query[\

I was trying to help with fixing (not fishing, as I mis-typed) some of the lining issues... hope that helps.

Running CI again... then hopefully we can get a test environment spun up. 

thanks for formatting... kicking CI to run it again.

@villebro  unfortunately the ephemeral environments have been broken for some time now 🙁 

Neat AI summary provided by @rusackas 🙂 \r\n\r\n\r\nKey changes include:\r\n1. Memoization optimizations:\r\n    - Added useMemo/useCallback hooks throughout components\r\n    - Memoized selectors with createSelector\r\n    - Reduced unnecessary re-renders\r\n2. Component modernization:\r\n    - Converted class components to functional components with hooks\r\n    - Removed redundant Redux connections in favor of useSelector/useDispatch\r\n    - Simplified prop passing and state management\r\n3. Architecture improvements:\r\n    - Moved Chart container logic directly into component\r\n    - Simplified data flow and prop drilling\r\n    - Better separation of concerns\r\n  \r\nThe main potential risk areas to watch:\r\n1. FilterBar and native filtering changes - ensure filter state management remains consistent with previous behavior\r\n2. Chart component refactoring - verify chart rendering and updates work correctly, especially around:\r\n    - Data loading states\r\n    - Filter interactions\r\n    - Resize handling\r\n3. Tab/Dashboard navigation - confirm tab state management and routing remains intact\r\n\r\n\r\nRecommend thorough testing of:\r\n    - Filter interactions\r\n    - Chart loading/rendering\r\n    - Dashboard navigation\r\n    - Cross-filter functionality\r\n    - Dashboard state persistence\r\n

@villebro Some pre-check (helm docs modified?)  failed for the previous commit, should I perform some additional action?

Ok guys i hope i got it this time\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c3a2142-716f-490c-b29e-ba80df505435)\r\n

@villebro Can I ask for review please?

hey @villebro  would it be possible to get this PR reviewed soon?

cc @michael-s-molina 

That was fast. Thanks for the quick merge!

@amotl if you\

@kgabryje ok, do you mean that setting ` ENABLE_DASHBOARD_DOWNLOAD_WEBDRIVER_SCREENSHOT = True ` would be enough to have the pdf generated on the backend?\r\n\r\nI thought that is only for scheduled dashboards

> @kgabryje ok, do you mean that setting `ENABLE_DASHBOARD_DOWNLOAD_WEBDRIVER_SCREENSHOT = True` would be enough to have the pdf generated on the backend?\r\n> \r\n> I thought that is only for scheduled dashboards\r\n\r\nNo, that feature flag enables downloading dashboard as an image through Selenium, not client-side. I meant that we should do a similar thing for downloading as PDF to fix the problem with loading charts

closing this PR as not relevant anymore

LGTM, put pinging some folks that probably know Trino better than me ;)

blocking issue: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/30919

Marking as draft until the docker image is published.

@lodu please rebase and update the chart version to 0.13.2, as I needed to bump the version here to 0.13.1: #30924

Since [4.1.1 docker images are available](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/superset/tags?name=4.1.1), this request can be merged.

This is a total pain, super happy to see this potentially get fixed soon! ❤️ 

Small typing suggestions, other than that the code looks great 👍 

@dkrat7 to my knowledge, columns are not dropped based on whether row level data are available for that column, but based upon whether the column is selected as part of the query. In your case, the columns will be dropped until the query is edited to include the desired columns.\r\n\r\nPoint being, if your query would include (or exclude) a column, then the virtual dataset will be synced to reflect the state of that query upon save.

/testenv up

> What will happen if I accidently make a change to a query which will result in zero rows returned - all columns including metadata will be permanently removed?\r\n\r\nIt should be fine, since the cursor should still return a description of the columns even if the number of rows is 0. For example, for Postgres:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport psycopg2\r\n\r\nquery = "SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE 1=0;"  # Query guaranteed to return zero rows\r\n\r\ndb_config = {\r\n    "dbname": "DB",\r\n    "user": "user",\r\n    "password": "password",\r\n    "host": "host",\r\n    "port": 5432,\r\n}\r\n\r\nwith psycopg2.connect(**db_config) as conn:\r\n    with conn.cursor() as cursor:\r\n        cursor.execute(query)\r\n\r\n        print("Cursor description:")\r\n        for col in cursor.description:\r\n            print(\r\n                f"Name: {col.name}, Type: {col.type_code}, Display Size: {col.display_size}"\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a test table this prints:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCursor description:\r\nName: show_id, Type: 25, Display Size: None\r\nName: type, Type: 25, Display Size: None\r\nName: title, Type: 25, Display Size: None\r\nName: director, Type: 25, Display Size: None\r\nName: country, Type: 25, Display Size: None\r\nName: date_added, Type: 25, Display Size: None\r\nName: release_year, Type: 23, Display Size: None\r\nName: rating, Type: 25, Display Size: None\r\nName: duration, Type: 25, Display Size: None\r\nName: listed_in, Type: 25, Display Size: None\r\nName: description, Type: 25, Display Size: None\r\nName: iso_date_added, Type: 25, Display Size: None\r\nName: iso_release_year, Type: 25, Display Size: None\r\nName: xata_version, Type: 23, Display Size: None\r\nName: xata_createdat, Type: 1184, Display Size: None\r\nName: xata_updatedat, Type: 1184, Display Size: None\r\nName: xata_id, Type: 25, Display Size: None\r\n```

FYI @yousoph 

LGTM, but @eschutho might be better poised to actually _test_ this before approving/merging.

@eschutho thanks for reviewing, pipeline fixed, could you merge it?

Think you could give this a pat down @betodealmeida ?

Is this a blocker or can this still be reviewed and merged?

Ah, let me take a look!

By all means, [slack](http://bit.ly/join-superset-slack) away... or start a GitHub Discussion and tag me there if you want more eyes on it.

I still see the package-lock though. I think you can just get it from master and replace it locally so it matches.

Oops, merged before the response about test cases... but I think this is something we should handle more broadly via a lint rule, no?

@vine-trellis feel free to bring in more test cases or add a lint rule as Evan suggested. That would be super helpful!

Hi @villebro, \r\nPlease see attached the current behaviour vs after the fix.\r\n\r\n## Settings Used:\r\nChart Type: Mixed Chart\r\nyhat = 1\r\nyhat_lower = -10\r\nyhat_upper = 5\r\nquery b = 10\r\n\r\n<img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc4c5b2f-e9dd-463d-8579-20954bd684d5">\r\n<img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8e00c17-c769-4cf4-984a-0c4daeaf3061">\r\n<img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/332c7ae8-0cb4-4a3b-b6d1-4cb15251e048">\r\n\r\n## Current Behaviour\r\n\r\n<img width="626" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20048db8-e12d-43cd-bd88-3cddab1f46f8">\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the confidence interval ranges between (0,15) instead of (-10,5).\r\n\r\n## After the fix\r\nSetting the same values we get the following response with correct confidence intervals (-10,5).\r\n\r\n<img width="1185" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f8ec037-202d-4108-9c29-7bcb2c4c4ebf">\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you do not reorder the props and send them to echarts as a json to generate the chart, the echarts package will default to an x axis that uses value and not time.

Looks like a mistake, this is pretty frequent, may I ask about the workflow that leads to open an upgrade-related PR on a public repo? Guessing you meant to target a fork?

@betodealmeida We discussed this PR during the daily PR review meeting, and we think we should aim for removing any dependency of `sqlparse` in accordance to [[SIP-117] Improve SQL parsing](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26786). This means that we prefer to remove formatting for these databases in favor of removing `sqlparse`. That being said, we understand that this would constitute a breaking change given that this feature exists in 4.0 for these databases. We agreed on keeping your solution but adding a `deprecated` annotation/comment to the code and remove the `sqlparse` dependency in 5.0 even if the dialects are not correctly supported by then. I added the following [ticket](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/345?pane=issue&itemId=83111151) to the 5.0 board. Could you add a `deprecated` annotation/comment to the code?\r\n\r\ncc @villebro @justinpark @sadpandajoe

@sfirke sorry for slow response, just did a commit, is it too late for the release (assuming it works this time)?

@Mainer-g00t @fmannhardt as you raised concerns here, did you find that this PR broke your use cases?

> @Mainer-g00t @fmannhardt as you raised concerns here, did you find that this PR broke your use cases?\r\n\r\nYes, it does. In our case, charts export filters that are picked up by jinja logic to filter dataset with data that is not part of the columns in the dataset. Specifically, our dataset looks like:\r\n\r\n-  customer (1k), products (1k), providers(1k), metrics...\r\n\r\nThis leads to a roughly 500M row table. We split it in 3 datasets, one for each dimension and use x-filters to select on the other datasets. ie, clicking on one customer on the first table will filter all products and providers for that customer and so on.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to display relationships in big datasets breaking it up in dimensions and using x-filters\r\n\r\n\r\n

Thanks @Mainer-g00t and @fmannhardt. Let me have a deeper look at what you are mentioning.

Hi @fmannhardt @Mainer-g00t @geido. May I suggest opening a specific GitHub issue for this so we can track it [here](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/418)?

Hi @michael-s-molina , \r\nWe opened a new issue with use case commented by @Mainer-g00t : https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/30687\r\n\r\nThanks

Closing this as per the concerns about having a third engine in the mix. 

Could you write a unit test that would fail before and succeed after? That will help review the logic by stating the assumptions in a unit test.

Happy to do so. Since I have no clue of the testing approach of Superset, could you help me find the correct spot to test? Would the correct file be:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/cc9fd88c0d2a2406f202da7dcea2f0d14f1d017e/tests/unit_tests/commands/export_test.py#L62\r\nor rather an integration test (since this also concerns code that also exports other resources:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/cc9fd88c0d2a2406f202da7dcea2f0d14f1d017e/tests/integration_tests/dashboards/commands_tests.py#L67

After some more searching, the example data used in the tests comes from here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/examples/world_bank.py\r\nand are manually created via code right? Or is there somewhere examples that exists as YAML files using the import/export feature? \r\n\r\nSearching for `native` in the examples folder does not find anything:\r\nhttps://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aapache%2Fsuperset+path%3A%2F%5Esuperset%5C%2Fexamples%5C%2F%2F+native&type=code\r\n\r\nSo, I would need to write code to create a dashboard with native filters from scratch? Or would there be a simpler way to write such test? I would need some guidance.

Hey @fmannhardt, \r\n\r\nThanks for working on this fix! 🙏 \r\n\r\nLooking at the code changes, I noticed you have re-introduced that code block to `file_content`, but it also remains present in the `_export` method. Is it required to have this block in both? For instance I see the `dataset_id = target.pop("datasetId", None)` in both blocks.\r\n\r\nIf we need them in both places, should we consider to move this logic to a helper/etc method to make it DRYer?

@Vitor-Avila I think it is required in both places to also invoke the export of the related datasets via `yield from ExportDatasetsCommand([dataset_id]).run()`. I agree that a refactoring would make sense. However, then there are also other parts that are duplicated such as: \r\n\r\n``` \r\n        payload = model.export_to_dict(\r\n            recursive=False,\r\n            include_parent_ref=False,\r\n            include_defaults=True,\r\n            export_uuids=True,\r\n``` \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that a completely different approach to separate the export to YAML/JSON and walking the dependency graph of the to be exported dashboard would be better. Maybe, first collecting all the dependencies and then going through the list of dependencies and exporting them. However, that would exceed the capacity that I have for contributing right now (and I am also not aware of any design decision that led to the current approach).\r\n\r\nI will try to add the test in the next few days.

It seems that I also need to write a fixture for the COVID dashboard, right? Bare with me, still exploring the setup of Superset testing and locally many other tests fail probably due to missing dependencies.  I will try to look at this tomorrow.

@fmannhardt thanks for working on this super critical regression. I will be reviewing this today and do my best to help unblock you.

Note: this is a fix for a regression that was introduced by #26765

Happy to help and thanks for the work on Superset. I may have time to look at this tomorrow (UTC+1). So, the existing fixtures hard code the dashboard and do not load from the examples? Just so I understand how to write it. It would be a copy of `world_bank_dashboard.py` but then the COVID dashboard code in there? \r\n\r\nIn case, it is easy for you to add the fixture I am also happy to update the test I wrote to work against it.

Test is disabled and current master branch is merged.

> Does it make sense to raise a warning that non-numeric data has been excluded when records are coerced to NaN?\r\n\r\nGood point @fisjac. I changed the logic to let users handle non-numeric values as they might want to fix their datasets or add filters to remove these values.
