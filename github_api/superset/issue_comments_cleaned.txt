<!-- Answer -->\nThe `%s` should be present in both `msgid` and `msgid_plural` in the `messages.pot` file for the "Added to dashboard" translation to handle pluralization correctly. `%s` is a placeholder for a variable, typically a number, that will be replaced at runtime. This is important for languages with different rules for singular and plural forms. The `msgid` is used for the singular form, and `msgid_plural` is used for the plural form, ensuring the translation system can correctly format the message based on the number of dashboards <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/translations/messages.pot)</sup>.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n\n---\n<sup>Help Dosu learn!

<!-- Answer -->\nThe `generate_po_files.sh` script is indeed mentioned in the `RELEASING/README.md` file as part of the release process for compiling translations for the backend <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/RELEASING/README.md)</sup>. However, it seems that this script does not exist in the repository. Instead, the `generate_mo_files.sh` script is present and is used to generate `.mo` binary files from `.po` translation files, which are used by the backend to load translations <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/scripts/translations/generate_mo_files.sh)</sup>.\n\nIt would be reasonable to update the `RELEASING/README.md` file to reference `generate_mo_files.sh` instead of `generate_po_files.sh`, as this aligns with the existing script in the repository.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n\n---\n<sup>Help Dosu learn!

I also think the cache function is the cause.\nDeck.gl Multi Layer Chart is a very good feature, but unfortunately it cannot be used when data changes dynamically due to this phenomenon.

Superset uses Git pre-commit hooks courtesy of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). To install run the following:\r\n```\r\npip3 install -r requirements/development.txt\r\npre-commit install\r\nA series of checks will now run when you make a git commit.\r\n```\r\nAlternatively it is possible to run pre-commit by running pre-commit manually:\r\n```\r\npre-commit run --all-files\r\n``` \r\nThat should fix up the pre-commit job on CI :)

It may be possible to fix this by adjusting where AntD inserts Toasts and Modals in the outer layer of the DOM, rather than bumping z-indexes around.

Issue #32394: Labels: data:connect:postgres, authentication:row-level-security
<!-- Answer -->\nThe error "dict is not a sequence" typically occurs when a dictionary is passed to a function that expects a sequence (like a list or tuple). In the context of Superset, this error is happening in the `pandas.io.sql` module when executing SQL queries, specifically in the `read_sql_query` function.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check SQL Parameters**: Ensure that the SQL query being executed does not have any dictionary objects where a sequence is expected. This might involve checking how parameters are being passed to the query.\n\n2. **Review RLS Filters**: Since the issue arises after applying Row Level Security (RLS) rules, verify that the RLS clauses are correctly formatted and do not inadvertently introduce dictionary objects into the query parameters.\n\n3. **Inspect the `values_for_column` Function**: This function constructs and executes the SQL query. Ensure that the parameters passed to `pd.read_sql_query` are correctly formatted. The `sql` and `con` arguments should be a valid SQL string and a SQLAlchemy connection object, respectively.\n\n4. **Debugging**: Add logging or print statements before the `pd.read_sql_query` call to inspect the `sql` and any parameters being passed. This can help identify if a dictionary is mistakenly being used.\n\n5. **PostgreSQL Specifics**: Since the issue is specific to PostgreSQL, ensure that any PostgreSQL-specific configurations or extensions are compatible with the RLS setup and the SQLAlchemy version in use.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, consider isolating the problem by creating a minimal example that reproduces the error, which can help in further debugging or seeking assistance.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n\n---\n<sup>Help Dosu learn!

This error might not be directly related to the special characters in metric labels but could be a result of how the request is being handled.\n\nRegarding the handling of special characters, Superset uses the `escape_value` function to escape special characters in CSV exports to prevent CSV injection vulnerabilities. This function specifically addresses characters like `%`, `-`, `@`, `+`, `|`, `=`, and `%` by escaping them to prevent potential security issues <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/utils/csv.py)</sup>.\n\nSince the error occurs only with the "Export to pivoted .CSV" option, it might be worth checking if the `exportCSVPivoted` function is correctly utilizing the `escape_value` function or if there are any discrepancies in how special characters are processed in this specific export path. Additionally, ensure that the server and client are using compatible HTTP versions, as this might be causing the 505 error.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n\n---\n<sup>Help Dosu learn!

<!-- Answer -->\nTo address the issue with Superset 4.1.1 assuming that Apache Pinot supports JOINs by default, you can configure Superset to explicitly disable JOIN operations for databases that do not support them. This can be done by setting the `allows_joins` attribute to `False` in the database configuration. This will prevent Superset from attempting JOIN operations that are not supported by your current Pinot setup <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs/README.md)</sup>.\n\nAdditionally, if you are using a version of Pinot that supports the multi-stage engine, you can enable it by adding the following argument in the database connection settings under Advanced -> Other -> ENGINE PARAMETERS:\n\n```json\n{"connect_args":{"use_multistage_engine":"true"}}\n```\n\nThis will allow Superset to perform JOIN operations if the multi-stage engine is available and enabled <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/docs/docs/configuration/databases.mdx)</sup>.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n\n---\n<sup>Help Dosu learn!

<!-- Answer -->\nI found a similar discussion titled [Integrating Keycloak with Superset (v4.1.1) - Issue with OAuth Login](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/32286) which is currently unsolved <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/32286)</sup>. \n\nTo address the issue where you are redirected back to the Superset login page with the error "The request to sign in was denied," consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Check Redirect URI**: Ensure that the `redirect_uri` configured in Keycloak matches the one expected by Superset. The `redirect_uri` should be correctly set in both Keycloak and Superset configurations.\n\n2. **Verify OAuth2 Configuration**: Make sure that the OAuth2 client configuration in Keycloak is correct, including the client ID, client secret, and allowed redirect URIs.\n\n3. **Inspect Browser Console and Network Logs**: Check the browser console and network logs for any errors or warnings that might provide more details about the sign-in request denial.\n\n4. **Check Superset Logs**: Review the Superset logs for any error messages or warnings related to the OAuth2 authentication process. Typical error messages include "OAUTH2_REDIRECT" and "OAUTH2_REDIRECT_ERROR" <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/errors.py)</sup>.\n\n5. **Ensure Correct Permissions**: Verify that the user has the necessary permissions in Keycloak to access the application.\n\n6. **Cross-Origin Requests**: Ensure that cross-origin requests are properly handled and that the `event.origin` and `event.source` checks in the `handleMessage` function are correctly validating the message source.\n\nAdditionally, a user shared a working configuration without installing any additional package such as `Flask-OIDC`.

Hi! I am Kasia and I am UX/UI designer contributing to Superset and working in Preset. \r\n\r\nIn this case caret is an action trigger/button. I agree with AI response to the PR, that these are patterns that are widely used in UX and intuitive for the general audience. The same pattern is used across the app in selects, dropdown triggers or similar collapsible sections (not including legacy components): \r\n<img width="607" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9442e746-4757-4ab3-adca-70e695ee2c34" />\r\n<img width="488" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e93c3ee-a1fb-4c24-bc9e-ba904e496ee0" />\r\nSo I would argue that the current implementation is the pattern that we should go with. \r\n

@michael-s-molina checking in to make sure you agree on switching this default since you shipped the feature. I could add in a feature flag `TIMESERIES_SHOW_PERCENTAGE_DEFAULT`, but feeling like we have enough feature flags without adding this new one.

Issue #32119: Labels: viz:charts:deck.gl
<!-- Answer -->\nThe DECK.GL MULTIPLE LAYERS chart in Apache Superset is designed to compose multiple layers together for complex visualizations. This chart type focuses on integrating multiple layers rather than relying on a single dataset or filter, which is why defining a dataset or filter might be considered unuseful for this chart <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-preset-chart-deckgl/src/Multi/index.ts)</sup>.\n\nRegarding the "View query" and "Run in SQL Lab" options returning "No query," this behavior is likely because the DECK.GL MULTIPLE LAYERS chart does not generate a single query that can be viewed or run in SQL Lab. Instead, it combines multiple layers, each potentially having its own data source and query logic <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/explore/components/useExploreAdditionalActionsMenu/index.jsx)</sup><sup>[[3]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/components/SliceHeaderControls/index.tsx)</sup>.\n\nFor hiding or greying out unnecessary UI elements, Apache Superset uses specific conditions and flags to manage the visibility of UI elements. These conditions are based on configuration values and control states, which determine when elements should be hidden or greyed out <sup>[[4]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/components/UiConfigContext/index.tsx)</sup><sup>[[5]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/plugins/plugin-chart-table/src/controlPanel.tsx)</sup>.\n\nThe error message "\

If the screenshot is not found in the cache, a 404 error is returned <sup>[[4]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/tests/integration_tests/dashboards/api_tests.py)</sup>.\n- Ensure that the "THUMBNAILS" feature is enabled, as the endpoint will return a 404 error if this feature is not active <sup>[[5]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/dashboards/api.py)</sup>.\n- There might be an issue with the caching mechanism in your Docker Compose environment. Proper configuration of the caching layer, often using Redis, is crucial for the efficient caching and retrieval of screenshots <sup>[[6]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/docs/docs/installation/architecture.mdx)</sup>.\n\nYou might want to verify these aspects to troubleshoot the issue further.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n\n---\n<sup>Help Dosu learn!

hi @salah34145 , this is not relevant to Superset actually as this is installation issue of `python-ldap` on your machine.
Issue #32023: Labels: authentication:sso
<!-- Answer -->\nTo ensure that the correct Keycloak user roles are assigned in Superset after integrating Single Sign-On with Keycloak, you need to map the roles from Keycloak to Superset roles using the `AUTH_ROLES_MAPPING` configuration. It seems like you have already set up the `AUTH_ROLES_MAPPING` in your `superset_config.py`, but the issue might be with how the roles are being extracted and used.\n\nHere are a few things to check and adjust:\n\n1. **Role Extraction**: In your `CustomSsoSecurityManager`, ensure that the roles are being correctly extracted from the Keycloak response. The `oauth_user_info` method should extract the roles from the correct field in the Keycloak response. It seems like you are using `role_keys`, but you should verify that this is the correct field in the Keycloak response.\n\n2. **Role Mapping**: Make sure that the roles you are mapping in `AUTH_ROLES_MAPPING` match exactly with the roles being sent by Keycloak. Any mismatch in role names will result in the default role being assigned.\n\n3. **Debugging**: Add logging to verify what roles are being received from Keycloak and how they are being processed. This can help identify if the roles are being correctly extracted and mapped.\n\n4. **Sync at Login**: Since you have `AUTH_ROLES_SYNC_AT_LOGIN` set to `True`, roles should be synced at every login. Ensure that this setting is being respected by checking the logs for any errors during the login process.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, you might want to review similar discussions for additional insights. For instance, there is an open discussion on [Assigning Superset roles to Keycloak authenticated users using the AUTH_ROLES_MAPPING](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/27902) that might provide more context or solutions <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/27902)</sup>.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n\n---\n<sup>Help Dosu learn!

This configuration is crucial for directing the migrations to the correct database.\n\n2. **Alembic Heads**: Check if there are multiple heads in your Alembic migrations. You can do this by running `alembic heads` to see if there are any discrepancies. If there are multiple heads, you might need to resolve them by merging branches or specifying a specific head.\n\n3. **Migration Scripts**: Verify that the migration scripts are correctly set up to apply changes to your MySQL database. Sometimes, specific migrations might have conditions that only apply to certain database types.\n\n4. **Logging**: Increase the logging level to `DEBUG` in your `alembic.ini` file to get more detailed output, which might help identify where the process is failing.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, you might want to look into any specific migration scripts that could have issues with MySQL, as there was a known issue with migration scripts in Superset 4.1.1 related to MySQL 8.0 <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/CHANGELOG.md)</sup>.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n\n---\n<sup>Help Dosu learn!

Hi, I’m also experiencing this issue, but I’m using MySQL as a metadata store. Even after changing the SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS, they were ignored, and the idle connections remained open despite the configured settings. I tried inspecting the source code to understand better how Apache Superset manages the connections, but I didn’t find any apparent errors. I’m using Apache Superset 4.1.1 and MySQL 8.2.\n\nIs there any change I need to apply besides the SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS to fine-tune the connection settings for my metadata store?\n\nMy settings:\n\n```\nSQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS = {\n    "pool_size": 50,  \n    "max_overflow": 10,       \n    "pool_timeout": 1,\n    "pool_recycle": 300,\n    "pool_pre_ping": True,\n}\n```

<!-- Answer -->\nI found a similar unsolved discussion that might be relevant to your issue: [Some permissions (on main page) seem unnecessary because they are associated with essential functions](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/31292). This discussion was last updated on December 4, 2024 <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/31292)</sup>. \n\nRegarding your issue, it seems like there might be a problem with how permissions are being configured or recognized in your setup. Here are a few things you might want to check:\n\n1. **Permission Synchronization**: Ensure that the permissions you added are correctly synchronized with the Superset roles. Sometimes, changes in permissions might not reflect immediately due to caching or synchronization issues.\n\n2. **Role Assignment**: Verify that the role with the new permissions is correctly assigned to the user you are testing with. Double-check the role assignments in the Superset UI.\n\n3. **Flask AppBuilder Configuration**: Since you are using Flask AppBuilder, ensure that the `TenantModelView` class and its permissions are correctly defined and registered. The `menu_cond` lambda function in your `SupersetAppInitializer` might also affect the visibility and accessibility of the views.\n\n4. **Logs and Debugging**: Check the Superset logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate what is going wrong. This can provide more context on why the permissions are not working as expected.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, you might need to delve deeper into the configuration and code to identify any discrepancies.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n\n---\n<sup>Help Dosu learn!

Installing the pre-commit hook should resolve at least some of the CI issues. \r\n\r\n/\r\nSuperset uses Git pre-commit hooks courtesy of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). To install run the following:\r\n```\r\npip3 install -r requirements/development.txt\r\npre-commit install\r\nA series of checks will now run when you make a git commit.\r\n```\r\nAlternatively it is possible to run pre-commit by running pre-commit manually:\r\n```\r\npre-commit run --all-files\r\n```

<!-- Answer -->\nTo restrict dataset access to a specific role, such as `power_user`, in Apache Superset, while ensuring that other roles like `Admin` and `Gamma` cannot access it, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a New Role**: First, create a new role named `power_user` by navigating to Menu -> Security -> List Roles and clicking the + sign.\n\n2. **Assign Permissions**: In the new role creation window, give this new role a name (`power_user`), attribute it to users, and select the specific tables or datasets in the **Permissions** dropdown that you want this role to have access to.\n\n3. **Restrict Access for Other Roles**: Ensure that the `Admin` and `Gamma` roles do not have permissions to access the specific datasets. Since `Admin` users have all possible rights by default, you may need to manage this by ensuring that only users with the `power_user` role are assigned to access the specific datasets.\n\n4. **Confirm Access**: Verify that users assigned to the `power_user` role can see the objects (dashboards and slices) associated with the datasets you have extended to them, and that users with `Admin` and `Gamma` roles do not have access to these datasets.\n\nThis approach leverages the role-based access control system in Superset to manage dataset access effectively <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/docs/docs/security/security.mdx)</sup>.\n\nRegarding Row Level Security (RLS), it can be used to apply filters to queries based on user roles, but it is not typically used to restrict access to entire datasets based on roles. Instead, RLS is more suited for filtering data within a dataset based on conditions related to roles <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/tests/integration_tests/security/row_level_security_tests.py)</sup>.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n\n---\n<sup>Help Dosu learn!

Dosubot is sort of right. Moving to PostgresSQL does appear to be a prerequisite but is only mentioned in Docker *specific* section of https://superset.apache.org/docs/configuration/alerts-reports and *not* in the Common section. IMO this is a bug as the default superset supports email reports and default database is SQLite. It should work out of the box.

@villebro there are roughly two reasons why we parse SQL in Superset:\r\n\r\n1. To extract referenced tables (enforcing data access roles, for example); and\r\n2. To modify the query (enforcing RLS, for example).\r\n\r\nThe feature from this PR falls in category 2. I think that any functionality in that category should always be optional, since there are always security and correctness concerns when modifying a query. So I would propose the following:\r\n\r\n- 5.0: add the feature flag, default to false.\r\n- 6.0: move the feature flag to a configuration option, default to false.

This is similar to a reverted PR here: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/29164\n\nIn a perfect world, it seems like there should be a world in which installing the Athena driver/dbapi would magically enable this Save To S3 option when configured. This probably requires a plugin architecture where the Athena plugin would offer a Save to S3 export plugin as a dependency... but this is a long way off.

Issue #31443: Labels: dashboard:import, api:dashboard, viz:charts:import
<!-- Answer -->\nThe current implementation of the `/api/v1/assets/import/` endpoint in Superset requires all dependencies to be included in the import bundle. This means that when importing a dashboard, you must also include the associated charts, datasets, queries, and databases. This approach ensures consistency and prevents drift between exported and imported resources, but it can be problematic in scenarios like multi-tenant environments or when different update policies are needed for different resource types.\n\nOne potential solution to this issue is to introduce a new parameter, such as `sparse`, to the import process. This parameter would allow the import process to use existing resources from the running database if the required dependencies are not found in the import bundle. This would provide more flexibility in managing resources across different Superset instances and environments.\n\nCurrently, there is no built-in mechanism in Superset to handle missing dependencies in this way, but your suggestion could be a valuable enhancement to consider for future development.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n\n---\n<sup>Help Dosu learn!

Issue #31339: Labels: authentication:access-control
<!-- Answer -->\nTo address the issue where a role has access to the "SWAP DATASET" button in Apache Superset, you need to review the permissions associated with that role. The "SWAP DATASET" button allows users to change the dataset used by a chart, which might not be desirable for all roles.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve this:\n\n1. **Review Role Permissions**: Ensure that the role does not have permissions that allow dataset swapping. Check if the role has been granted permissions like `can_write` or other permissions that might implicitly allow dataset modifications.\n\n2. **Dashboard RBAC**: If the **DASHBOARD_RBAC** feature flag is enabled, you can manage which roles can access specific dashboards. This feature allows you to bypass dataset-level checks and control access more granularly. Ensure that the role is configured correctly under this feature if it\

Fixed and committed a little linting issue nag, and re-ran CI. Hopefully it passes this time.\r\n\r\nSuperset uses Git pre-commit hooks courtesy of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). To install run the following:\r\n```\r\npip3 install -r requirements/development.txt\r\npre-commit install\r\nA series of checks will now run when you make a git commit.\r\n```\r\nAlternatively it is possible to run pre-commit by running pre-commit manually:\r\n```\r\npre-commit run --all-files\r\n```

<!-- Greeting -->\nOlá @pcajubr! Eu sou [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), um bot aqui para te ajudar a resolver bugs, responder perguntas e se tornar um colaborador. Estou aqui para te ajudar enquanto aguardamos um mantenedor humano. Vamos resolver isso juntos! 🤖\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nThe issue with thumbnails not working in the Dashboards menu after upgrading to Superset 4.1.1 might be related to changes in how thumbnails are managed, particularly in terms of caching and asynchronous processing. In version 4.1.1, the `/thumbnail/<digest>/` endpoint was updated to handle cache misses by initiating an asynchronous task to compute the thumbnail if it does not exist in the cache <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/dashboards/api.py)</sup>.\n\nHere are a few things you can check or try:\n\n1. **Feature Flags and Configuration**: Ensure that the `FeatureFlag.Thumbnails` is enabled in your configuration. This flag controls the visibility of thumbnails in the frontend <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/config.py)</sup>.\n\n2. **Cache Configuration**: Verify that your cache system is properly configured and operational. Thumbnails are stored in the cache, and any issues with the cache could affect their display.\n\n3. **Celery Workers**: Make sure that your Celery workers are running correctly, as they are responsible for processing the asynchronous tasks that generate thumbnails.\n\n4. **Browser Cache**: Clear your browser cache or try accessing the dashboard in an incognito window to rule out any caching issues on the client side.\n\n5. **Logs and Errors**: Check the Superset logs for any errors related to thumbnail generation or caching. This might provide more insight into what is going wrong.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, it might be helpful to look into any specific changes made to the `DashboardCard` component or related components between versions 4.0.2 and 4.1.1, as these could also impact thumbnail rendering.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n

Hi! I appreciate the change, but the change needs to be made in the Jupyter notebook. I hope [this](https://preset.io/blog/how-and-when-and-why-to-update-apache-supersets-country-maps/) helps :) \r\n

<!-- Answer -->\nThe Docker image for version 4.1.0 is not available because, starting with this release, the Docker image does not include the necessary drivers needed to operate Superset. Users are required to install drivers for their metadata database (MySQL or Postgres) and their data warehouse separately. This change is due to modifications in the `lean` Docker image that official releases are based on. For more details, you can refer to the [Docker Build Presets](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/docs/docs/installation/docker-builds.mdx#build-presets) <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/RELEASING/release-notes-4-1/README.md)</sup>.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n

Hi @BaurArabov - for the process of this, feel free to kick off a [DISCUSS] thread on the Superset Dev mailing list to begin the official consensus-building process.\r\n\r\nSome initial thoughts/questions:\r\n• Are there more use cases you can share?\r\n• If the use case is just extending "Custom conditional formatting" and/or "Show Cell Bars" into the footer/aggregate cell, maybe that could be checkboxes in the control panel.

Is user impersonation really needed for OAuth? I would have assumed OAuth mostly makes user impersonation redundant, as you already have full user-specific authentication in place (no need for a service account).

Docker pull will not work, since it is not an image in the sense that it is. It is the [build](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/backends/) cache that is stored inside.\r\n\r\n[docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L40C7-L40C47) contains information about how the image is being used:\r\n```\r\nx-common-build: &common-build\r\n  context: .\r\n  target: dev\r\n  cache_from:\r\n    - apache/superset-cache:3.10-slim-bookworm\r\n  args:\r\n    DEV_MODE: «true» \r\n```\r\n\r\nCache_from is just that.\r\n\r\nYou

Issue #30961: Labels: size/M, data:csv
### UPDATE: Export Pivot Tables into CSV Format\r\n\r\nIn the last commit, I made a small change to export pivot tables without flattening multi-index rows/columns. This feature, initially implemented by the community for managing JSON export, is particularly unhelpful when dealing with pivot tables exported into CSV format with a large number of columns corresponding to a multi-index.\r\n\r\nTo better explain the issue, I have attached an example. If I create a pivot table with many columns associated with multi-index rows, the flattening process transforms them into a single column with a field value obtained by concatenating all fields separated by a space. This approach is not very effective if we want to use these exports in Excel or other tools.\r\n\r\n##### Example:\r\n\r\nI created this pivot table using your example dataset:\r\n\r\n![pivot_table](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f71798c-36d2-4989-b8e4-1f9cc5f790b7)\r\n\r\nThe AS-IS behavior generates this type of file, where the MultiIndex columns get collapsed into one row and MultiIndex Rows get merged into a single column, obtained by concatenating all fields separated by a space. This export is not very easy to use in Excel for the next steps.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c142d4b3-2a48-4fbf-afe9-15b48121f9a5)\r\n\r\n[export_as_is_20241119_101212.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17814564/export_as_is_20241119_101212.csv)\r\n\r\nThe TO-BE behavior generates this type of file, where the MultiIndex rows/columns get preserved:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7796e2a6-031a-415a-abf5-ed460244bbfb)\r\n\r\n[export_to_be_20241119_100853.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17814637/export_to_be_20241119_100853.csv)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Code Complete\r\n\r\n~~~python\r\ndef apply_post_process(\r\n    result: dict[Any, Any],\r\n    form_data: Optional[dict[str, Any]] = None,\r\n    datasource: Optional[Union["BaseDatasource", "Query"]] = None,\r\n) -> dict[Any, Any]:\r\n    form_data = form_data or {}\r\n\r\n    viz_type = form_data.get("viz_type")\r\n    if viz_type not in post_processors:\r\n        return result\r\n\r\n    post_processor = post_processors[viz_type]\r\n\r\n    for query in result["queries"]:\r\n        if query["result_format"] not in (rf.value for rf in ChartDataResultFormat):\r\n            raise Exception(  # pylint: disable=broad-exception-raised\r\n                f"Result format {query[\

Issue #30892: Labels: data:connect:mysql
<!-- Answer -->\nThere is a known issue with cross-database queries in Superset, particularly when using the Superset meta database, which can lead to `GENERIC_DB_ENGINE_ERROR` errors. This error typically occurs when the database returns an unexpected error, and it is associated with error code `1002` <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/errors.py)</sup>.\n\nSome potential causes for this error when querying MySQL tables include:\n\n1. **Connection Errors**: Ensure that the connection details (username, password, host, database name) are correct. Common issues include access denied errors, unknown host, or the database being unreachable <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs/mysql.py)</sup>.\n\n2. **Syntax Errors**: Check for any syntax errors in the SQL query. The error message might indicate where the syntax issue is located <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs/mysql.py)</sup>.\n\n3. **URI Query Parameters**: Certain URI query parameters are disallowed for security reasons, such as `local_infile` for `mysqldb` and `allow_local_infile` for `mysqlconnector`. Ensure these are set to `0` <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs/mysql.py)</sup>.\n\nAdditionally, the Superset meta database has some limitations and considerations, such as security concerns, performance issues, and row limitations, which might affect cross-database queries <sup>[[3]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/docs/docs/configuration/databases.mdx)</sup>.\n\nReview these aspects to diagnose and resolve the issue. If the problem persists, further investigation into the specific error messages and database logs may be necessary.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n

Hello @dosu\r\nYes those configurations are in place.

That is why I was configuring Async, hoping that gets resolved.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that turning "GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES" to True, makes the graphs in the dashboard to load forever.\r\nEDIT:\r\nI also noticed that even after making sure that redis-headless is up and configured, some calles are trying to reach redis in "127.0.0.1:6379"

<!-- Answer -->\nThe message "ineligible item(s) are hidden" in the Mixed Chart sidebar appears when there are metrics or columns that are not displayed due to being hidden by default. This happens when the `hiddenMetricCount` or `hiddenColumnCount` is greater than zero, indicating that some items are not shown because they exceed the default maximum length or are collapsed <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/explore/components/DatasourcePanel/DatasourcePanelItem.tsx)</sup><sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/explore/components/DatasourcePanel/DatasourcePanelItem.test.tsx)</sup>.\n\nWhen you open Query A or Query B, the metrics and columns become visible because these sections are expanded, allowing you to see and configure the items that were previously hidden. This behavior is part of the design to manage the display of items in the sidebar efficiently.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n

@betodealmeida We discussed this PR during the daily PR review meeting, and we think we should aim for removing any dependency of `sqlparse` in accordance to [[SIP-117] Improve SQL parsing](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26786). This means that we prefer to remove formatting for these databases in favor of removing `sqlparse`. That being said, we understand that this would constitute a breaking change given that this feature exists in 4.0 for these databases. We agreed on keeping your solution but adding a `deprecated` annotation/comment to the code and remove the `sqlparse` dependency in 5.0 even if the dialects are not correctly supported by then. I added the following [ticket](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/345?pane=issue&itemId=83111151) to the 5.0 board. Could you add a `deprecated` annotation/comment to the code?\r\n\r\ncc @villebro @justinpark @sadpandajoe

<!-- Answer -->\nThe error "TypeError: t is undefined" in the context of deck.gl visualizations can be challenging to diagnose without specific details. However, here are a few things you might consider checking:\n\n1. **Data Format**: Ensure that the output of your `geojson_encode_path` UDF is in the correct format expected by the deck.gl Path layer. The expected input format should match the deserialization process used in Superset, which involves JSON, polyline, or geohash formats <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/viz.py)</sup>.\n\n2. **Data Deserialization**: Verify that the data is being deserialized correctly. Superset uses a deserialization map (`deser_map`) to handle different line types. Make sure that the data type returned by your UDF is compatible with the expected deserialization function.\n\n3. **Frontend Error Handling**: Superset\

Hello @praveer38 : this is an issue with Flask-AppBuilder.  Superset uses FAB for much of its code, including security.  You would need to change the line [here](https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/blob/1d27eb42a4f9b6e19fb3c025327b4110b175eccb/flask_appbuilder/security/views.py#L194) and [here](https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/blob/1d27eb42a4f9b6e19fb3c025327b4110b175eccb/flask_appbuilder/security/views.py#L219).\r\n\r\nCould you please submit that change as a pull request to that repository?

Issue #30504: Labels: No Labels
<!-- Answer -->\nThe visibility of the "Allow file uploads to database" option in the connection creation dialog is controlled by the condition `isFileUploadSupportedByEngine`. This condition checks if the database engine supports file uploads. If `isFileUploadSupportedByEngine` is true, the option is displayed <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/features/databases/DatabaseModal/ExtraOptions.tsx)</sup>.\n\nIf the option is missing during the creation of a connection but present during editing, it might be due to the database engine not supporting file uploads at the time of creation, or the condition not being met for some reason. You might want to verify if the database engine supports file uploads and ensure that the condition is correctly evaluated during the creation process.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n

This is checked in the `explore_json` method:\n     ```python\n     if (\n         response_type == ChartDataResultFormat.CSV\n         and not security_manager.can_access("can_csv", "Superset")\n     ):\n         return json_error_response(\n             _("You don\

Issue #30372: Labels: install:docker, viz:thumbnail
<!-- Answer -->\nThe error "Process unexpectedly closed with status signal" when generating thumbnails in Superset within a Docker Compose environment is likely due to insufficient memory allocation for the `superset-worker` service. \n\nTo resolve this, you can increase the memory limit for the `superset-worker` service by uncommenting and adjusting the `mem_limit` and `mem_reservation` settings in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Here is the relevant section with the memory settings uncommented:\n\n```yml\n  superset-worker:\n    build:\n      <<: *common-build\n    container_name: superset_worker\n    command: ["/app/docker/docker-bootstrap.sh", "worker"]\n    env_file:\n      - path: docker/.env # default\n        required: true\n      - path: docker/.env-local # optional override\n        required: false\n    environment:\n      CELERYD_CONCURRENCY: 2\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    depends_on: *superset-depends-on\n    user: *superset-user\n    volumes: *superset-volumes\n    extra_hosts:\n      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"\n    healthcheck:\n      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "celery -A superset.tasks.celery_app:app inspect ping -d celery@$$HOSTNAME"]\n    # Bump memory limit if processing selenium / thumbnails on superset-worker\n    mem_limit: 2038m\n    mem_reservation: 128M\n```\n\nBy increasing the memory limit, you can help ensure that the `superset-worker` has enough resources to process thumbnails without running into memory-related issues <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)</sup>.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n
