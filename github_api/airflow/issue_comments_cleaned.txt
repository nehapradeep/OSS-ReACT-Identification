You are not supposed to be able to do this. I think this is an end result of #47810‚Äîonly one of the assets is active, and we should hide the other from the UI (at least by default), and you should not be able to trigger the inactive asset from UI.\n\nThe trigger API should also be modified to include a check to not run the DAG at all if it contains an inactive asset.

> We could also move the ConfigMap patching step into a Breeze k8s utility that runs before shell and test commands.

I always prefer to run setup - if only possible - in a pytest fixture, as this makes tests far more portable in general. We had a lot, a lot of cases where we had some environmental setup in outside scripts or even breeze image and that was a cause for many problems where someone attempted to run tests in not-exactly-the-way-it-was-supposed-to-be causing lots of confusion and time lost for diagnosing the issues.

Issue #47484: Labels: area:task-sdk
I added an additional commit to remove db calls in `iter_dag_dependencies` as well. This is called during DAG serialization. The result is stored in the SerializedDag and sent to the UI later. Removing the calls makes the UI not quite right, but @Lee-W is already working on changing the API around this.

Hey @vincbeck, I‚Äôd love to get your thoughts on this.\r\n\r\nI‚Äôve tested the connection setup, and this PR mainly focuses on documentation. Adding a test file could help validate the setup better.\r\n\r\nWhile working on example_exasol_to_s3.py, I noticed exasol_to_s3 could be refactored for clearer separation of concerns, making testing easier. Thinking of including this in the PR‚Äîdoes that sound good to you?\r\n\r\nI‚Äôll adjust the docs as needed once we decide. Looking forward to your thoughts! üöÄ

> Just a question, it looks like before `filter_permitted_dag_ids` and `get_permitted_dag_ids` would return a dag id if we had read or write permission on it.\r\n> \r\n> Now this is not the case anymore, we absolutely need the `read`. Are we sure that existing installation always set "GET" access when they grant "PUT" access to a user, could that cause disruption ? For instance certain legacy endpoint would not specify the method, defaulting to `GET` or `PUT`.\r\n\r\nNo, if you pass method="PUT", you do not need read access, only the edit access. `GET` is the default value for `method` but it does not mean you must have it

We actually need to keep the config. APIs provided by the FAB auth manager (such as users, roles, ...) need the auth backends. These APIs have not been migrated to fastapi and are still using Flask. Therefore, they need the auth backends. I updated the config description to reflect that.

Issue #47348: Labels: kind:bug, priority:high, area:core, affected_version:3.0.0beta
Check the Serialization Logic:\n\nThe error is occurring in the XCom.serialize_value method, which is trying to serialize the user-defined macros using JSON. The XComEncoder is raising an error because it encounters a reserved key (__classname__) in the dictionary.\n\nYou need to ensure that the user-defined macros do not contain any reserved keys or special characters that might interfere with the serialization process.\n\nModify the User-Defined Macros:\n\nInstead of directly passing the result of the macro functions (user_macro1(225) and user_macro2(100)), pass the functions themselves and call them within the task. This way, the serialization will handle the functions rather than their results, which might contain problematic keys.\n\nUpdate the DAG Definition:\n\nModify the DAG definition to pass the macro functions themselves rather than their results. Then, call these functions within the task.

If you really want to keep `@property` you might be able to return a coroutine\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass AwsGenericHook:\r\n    @property\r\n    def async_conn(self) -> coroutine[client]:\r\n        return sync_to_async(self._get_async_conn)()\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut you will still need to await it\r\n\r\n```python\r\nasync def run(self):\r\n    client = await self.hook.async_conn\r\n```\r\n\r\nand thus it will be a breaking change for `async_conn`.

> It updated all the provides because of schema change in template file?\r\n\r\nI manually run `breeze release-management prepare-provider-documentation --reapply-templates-only --answer yes` to apply them. This is doing the same as what release manager would do but without bumping version numbers and regenerating commit list and changelog entries, just applying templates and regenerating what is automaticlaly generated.

Please complain to mysql creators who added a requirement to use `pkgconf` if your mysql python library does not have binary wheel. They changed few months ago. We captured it in the description of our local virtualenv - explaining what kind of prerequisites you need for that:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/07_local_virtualenv.rst#local-virtual-environment-virtualenv\n\nIf you think there are better ways how to describe it better or make it works better - PRs are always welcome.\n\nAlternatively you can open an issue in mysql repo and complain there.

@pierrejeambrun , We now have an Asset Alias. Can we consider this as an Asset Access Entity? Similar to how Dag runs is a Dag Access Entity.\r\n\r\nOr should these be considered a separate entity and create AssetAliasDetail? As alias will have its own id and use invokes API with `/assets/aliases/{asset_alias_id},`. We will not get any info about the asset_id here.

I agree. I also found it confusing to have [serialization](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/authoring-and-scheduling/serializers.html) and [dag file processing](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/authoring-and-scheduling/dagfile-processing.html) in `Authoring and Scheduling`. I see `Authoring and Scheduling` a section of the doc for DAG authors that help them understanding how to write and schedule DAGs, I am not sure these docs fit will in this section? Maybe "core concepts"?

If the split is impossible due to the creation of cross-dependency concerns, we may extract a separate provider without the GCS Hook in it.\n\nLogging, fs, auth and assets are mostly self-contained. \nVendoring some kind of `MiniGCSHook` for the gcs logging handler is quite easy.\n\nThe GCS Hook changes history (before the migration) shows that PRs were mostly self-contained to file and the tests of it for the last two years:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/commits/857ca4c06c9008593674cabdd28d3c30e3e7f97b/airflow/providers/google/cloud/hooks/gcs.py?browsing_rename_history=true&new_path=providers/google/src/airflow/providers/google/cloud/hooks/gcs.py&original_branch=main

Hi @pierrejeambrun,  \r\n\r\nHere is a draft for the first entity that introduces authentication and permissions. I want to ensure consistency across other entities and would appreciate your advice on the following changes:  \r\n\r\n- **`tests/api_fastapi/conftest.py`**  \r\n  - Added a bearer token with an admin role to the original `test_client` fixture.  \r\n  - Renamed the original `test_client` to `unauthenticated_test_client` (since adding the `requires_access_*` dependencies to routers means we should now respect the authorization header).  \r\n\r\n- **`tests/api_fastapi/core_api/routes/public/test_dags.py`**  \r\n  - Is adding `_should_response_401` test cases for each router sufficient?  \r\n  - Or should we cover more scenarios, such as Vertical Privilege Escalation?  \r\n\r\nLooking forward to your thoughts!\r\ncc @rawwar

Hey @ramitkataria, it is not easy for us to track each provider and each usage when such custom behaviour is implemented in inheriting hooks. From your justification, seems like you know the cause of the error, could you try and potentially fix it too?\r\n\r\n- One thing I would do is, log the response `self.conn` or related errors to see what is going wrong for starters.

Another idea I thought during testing would be in case of failed latest dagrun get to the dagrun page with task instances filtered by `state=failed&state=upstream_failed&state=up_for_retry` in the url param. But it felt like too much magic since there could be other reasons of failure with no failed taskinstance like dagrun is marked manually as failed and differs from successful dagrun.

I have one more question. I noticed that `arg_subdir` is an unused argument in the `dag_state` cli command since the required fields are `dag_id` and either `logical_date` or `run_id` (which are unique for each DAG run).  \r\n\r\nDo you think we should modify the function to support `dag-bundle`, allowing it to display all DAG runs for the specified `dag_bundle`, or should I simply remove `arg_subdir`?

> I think you should not replace the old ways. Maybe you can add new ways and say create "NativeTrinoOperator" to do things differently. There is a good reason why we have the common sql abstraction and we want all databases to have more or less the same behviour and this is the way we want to promote it with our users: this allows them to easily switch between different datbases - mostly by changing connections.\r\n> \r\n> Happy to review it when it is changed to be "addition".\r\n\r\nThere was a dedicated TrinoOperator, which was deprecated in favor of SQLExecuteQueryOperator (Issue #25259).\r\n\r\nHowever, SQLExecuteQueryOperator does not fully support Trino‚Äôs client protocol. Trino requires the client to fetch results before finalizing query execution. Without this, Trino cancels the query with a USER_CANCELED error, even when data modifications have been applied. This leads to unreliable data modification handling.\r\n\r\nI implemented TrinoOperator as a subclass of SQLExecuteQueryOperator since the required change is minimal, it ensures results are fetched. This approach is consistent with how other databases with unique behaviors are handled in Airflow. For example, TeradataOperator and SnowflakeOperator also inherit from SQLExecuteQueryOperator while implementing their own specifics.

Sorry, but you start to use some weird `tests_common` package in your imports which is not well defined as test dependency or else. You better to define it as some subpackadge of airflow package or create `airflow.testing package` - the best idea to share common test utils, or to use pytest fixtures, but never ever import something from tests into tests.

Background from Slack:\r\n\r\n> Yes breeze down is the way to go. The issue is that while we have ‚Äúin-progress‚Äù work or when you switch branches  - some of the migrations might or might not be valid, and your database might or might not be upgradeable/healthy. Breeze down cleans up the volumes used by the DB and generally make the DB reinitialize from scratch next time\r\n\r\n> It‚Äôs rather difficult to find out when you should clean-up the database (for example this might happen when you just rebase to latest version of airlfow or go back to previous version because your old PR was based on old version of airflow - but maybe someone could come with a proposal how to communicate it better in case this happens

Implementation wise, here is my thinking. I am starting by `MessageQueueTrigger`.\r\n\r\nGiven `msg_queue`, `MessageQueueTrigger` needs to figure which hook it will use to poll/pop a message from the queue. Example: `if msg_queue.starts_with("https://sqs."): hook = SqsHook(...)`. Then we can use the hook to retrieve the message. The hook will contain the logic for each provider (AWS, Google, Kafka, ...). This means, this new provider will have a dependency with all these providers. Do you think this is an issue? Did you have something else in mind?

Nice. Good one @amoghrajesh.

I believe the approach I took in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/46608. that cleans-up a lot of common and duplicated provider code after we moved all providers is better.\r\n\r\nIt should fix the deprecations_ignore.yml problem. After removing the "old" way providers were added and basically removing the entire "providers" package we could do the deprecations_ignore differently -  namely instead of adding deprecations_ignore purely for the provider in question, we are adding all deprecations_ignore found in all providers, ALWAYS in pytest_plugin. \r\n\r\nThis way:\r\n\r\na) we can keep deprecations_ignore in corresponding providers\r\nb) no matter which provider is run, the ignores are added for all of them\r\nc) we do not have to copy around the code that reads the deprecations_ignore\r\n\r\nI have to still make the PR green - there are still few things failing there, and also add some more docs and templating/pre-commits to make sure that "integration" and "system" tests in provider have the right __init__.py files and few more things to remove, but this evening the tests in CI already look very promising -  I have most integration tests running and the deprecation warnings from google provider seem to be handled well - via the above mechanism.\r\n\r\ncc: @ashb \r\n\r\n> (Also wow that\

@pierrejeambrun I have refactored them to a common component `DurationChart` . Most of the part is same for task instance and dag run except the queued duration calculation which needs `queued_when` and `queued_at` . I am passing `kind` to denote the type and also using it in switch case to use the correct attribute for queued duration. I am new to JS/React refactoring. Please let me know if there is a better way. Another approach I thought of was making the component as a base class and each class `TaskInstanceDurationChart` and `DagRunDurationChart` inherits from the base class to implement queued logic duration calculation as a function for the respective class.

From your initial PR conversation, I understood you are referencing the part where you extract `total_entries` from the response, and it shows all `total_entries` despite the limit set to 14.\n\nIf so I believe that this number is not affected by pagination limits and offsets, the `total_entries` would be based on count from `filters=` fields. \n\n```python\n    dag_run_select, total_entries = paginated_select(\n        statement=query,\n        filters=[logical_date, start_date_range, end_date_range, update_at_range, state],\n        order_by=order_by,\n        offset=offset,\n        limit=limit,\n        session=session,\n    )\n```\n\nAnd with curl it works as you mention:\n<details>\n\n  <summary>curl run for 2 entries</summary>\n  \n  \n  ```bash\ncurl -X \

Yeah. Some problems are expected - especially for such huge providers as amazon. This is one of the reasons we did no move all providers at once, because rather than havin 10 people solving those things individually, we would have to have 1 person solving all 100 providers issues at once, we are basically crowd-sourcing problem solving.\r\n\r\nBut I see my role here as help to guide people (and I did that in other providers) how to solve those difficult issues.

Old signature:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MyOperatorLink(BaseOperatorLink):\r\n    def get_link(self, operator, dttm):\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew signature:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MyOperatorLink(BaseOperatorLink):\r\n    def get_link(self, operator, *, ti_key):\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that in the old signature, `dttm` is used by Airflow as a _positional_ argument, so the argument name in the function declaration may not be `dttm`. In the new signature, however, the argument name must be `ti_key` (although it may be non-keyword-only; `self, operator, ti_key` should be considered new signature). So the deprecated signature detection rule should be **exactly three positional arguments, the third one not named `ti_key`**.\r\n\r\nThe migration tool should search files for subclasses of `BaseOperatorLink`, and check their `get_link` declaration.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the tool should check all entries defined in the `operator_extra_links` list of a plugin, even if it does not subclass `BaseOperatorLink`, because Airflow does not actually require you to subclass, as long as the signature match at runtime. But this can be difficult to do, so I think it‚Äôs OK to ignore this. We always subclass `BaseOperatorLink` in documentation, and the non-subclass implementation works only by accident.\r\n\r\nRelevant documentation on operator extra link: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/define-extra-link.html

I think it is not good to reduce the grace time to fail in case of HTTP 500. Most often K8s infra recovery or a DB restart takes longer than 3 minutes.\r\nFrom the productive use of Edge Worker we can say that the most stable situation we have is by the settingss we made currently as default. I fear reducing this will lower the quality of service.\r\n\r\nI propose to handle functional problems in a different error code to skip retry.\r\n\r\nIf you reduce it as here in the PR, please make it configurable at least such that we can increase it back to 10 attempts, else I fear it will lower the stability when moving to Task SDK.

Nice. For now the `dag_id` (name) is always used as the secondary sort criteria to ensure stability in the result set returned. (In case the primary criteria has identical values).\n\nWhen we use a descending sort, the secondary filter (which is the primary key of the table, here the `dag_id` is also `.desc()`).\n\nIn the following code `column` is the primary sort criteria, the one specified by the user. `primary_key_column` is the secondary sort criteria always used and retrieved from the models.\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/ee6bd7ee162ff295b86d86fdd1b356c51b9bba78/airflow/api_fastapi/common/parameters.py#L202-L205\n\nI think we need to support multisort to be able to handle this case. Users would be able to specify that they want to sort on the primary criteria in asc(), but on a secondary criteria in desc() order for intance. (Or any other arbitrary combination).

I think it is valueable to run Draft PRs also through CI. Then as a contributor you can have early feedback. Before opening a PR up toreviewers and generating notifications. What else should a WIP/Draft PR be for?\r\nOr do we need to fear that we have too high CI workload and need to reduce infra capacity? Then still a reduced run would be of value in my view.

Great Idea. We could even automate it easily for all providers - especially now after they are moved to separate repos. \n\nOur "validate provider yaml" already has the code to read and import all the provider  "entities" created - so turning that into generated "__all__" imports at the top-level of the provider should be easy.

For context on why we are removing this:\r\n\r\n1. It never actually made it in to a release (it was tagged with 2.10.0 milestone but somehow got missed in that release)\r\n2. It relies on AIP-44 and the pydantic models it creates to work, and those have been removed in main/Airflow 3\r\n3. With the split out of the new standard provider it will be easier to add this back in quicker, but trying to support it now will delay Airflow 3 work as we have a long list of _critical_ features related ti AIP-72/Task Execution interface, and unfortunately we have to cut something.\r\n\r\nSorry to revert this yet again :(

Issue #46268: Labels: area:providers, provider:cncf-kubernetes
The mentioned bug in the spark k8s operator test is related to mocking and new changes. \r\n\r\nPreviously, tests were failed because the new KPO `execute()` validates the name set for a pod on an operator by calling `_set_name` (because of templating changes, we need to have context applied to templates before name validation).\r\nThus the tests in k8s spark operator with `mock_create_job_name` could not succeed. MagickMock is not a str instance, so validation failed.\r\n\r\nThis led me to understand that calls to `assert op.name.startswith("...")` are broken in these tests, otherwise, they would fail too (this is checked after operator execution). My investigation showed that changing prefix to anything like `name.startswith("ABRA-CADABRA")` didn\

Issue #46193: Labels: kind:meta, area:datasets
hey @dstandish , would like to confirm: does it mean a dag with the following structure should never have logical date and data interval? Or just the dag runs that are triggered by assets?\n\n```python\nfrom airflow.timetables.datasets import DatasetOrTimeSchedule\nfrom airflow.timetables.trigger import CronTriggerTimetable\n\n\n@dag(\n    schedule=DatasetOrTimeSchedule(\n        timetable=CronTriggerTimetable("0 1 * * 3", timezone="UTC"), datasets=(dag1_dataset & dag2_dataset)\n    )\n    # Additional arguments here, replace this comment with actual arguments\n)\ndef example_dag():\n    # DAG tasks go here\n    pass\n```

> For the problem in general, do you think if we tweak the validation/serialization alias for datamodels, for example, for connection_id, will the problem still persist?\r\n\r\nAt least in the ConnectionBody case, yeah. we can def just use `conn_id`(which is the column in db) instead of `connection_id`. we can just update tests to make it work. Should I make this change? Unless we need "connection_id" to be in the model\r\n

Aside from that it‚Äôs just the seemingly redundant `type()` calls left. We should remove them if possible, or find out why they are needed.

The only failures are caused by:  \r\n- UI static check  \r\n- Compatibility tests for `2.9.3:P3.9` and `2.10.4:P3.10` providers (likely broken due to the new provider structure?)  \r\n- Flaky test: `TestWorkflowTrigger.test_task_workflow_trigger_skipped`  \r\n\r\nDo we need to fix the compatibility tests, or is this PR ready to be merged?

@Arjit-Sharma001 Given that the current version of the cncf provider is [10.1](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes/stable/changelog.html), there have clearly been many bug fixes and improvements since 4.3.0.  There will not be any fixes to old versions so, if you are able to, can you test your problem against a newer version?

Issue #45902: Labels: kind:bug, area:CI, area:core, needs-triage
No. We have https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/breeze/doc/ci/04_selective_checks.md that implement deliberate skipping of some parts of test workflow where the heuristics analysis in `selective checks` determines that some of the tests can be skipped. This is to make the tests faster and take less resources. \n\nThere are sometimes false-negatives - i.e. skipping tests where they should be run, but we are looking at those cases and fixing them as we find them, also we have "canary" builds in `main` run every 6 hours that run full set of tests in main to see if we accidentally merged something that should have not passed the tests in PR.\n\nIf you have concrete example where tests did not run when they should, feel free to report them individually in separate issues - or just explain it in`#internal-airflow-ci-cd` slack channel on Airlfow Slack.\n

as explained in slack - you can replace the confilcting images / .txt with either versions, rebase and re-run pre-commit. The images wil get regenerated to be "latest" automatically (in fact it should happen automatically when you rebase your PR and resolve the conflicts if you did `pre-commit install` before).

### Fix for `airflow-web` Issue\n\n1. **Check the Maximum ID**:\n   - Run the query:  \n     `SELECT MAX(id) FROM session;`  \n     Result: `2147483647`\n\n2. **Delete Recent Entries**:\n   - Execute the query:  \n     `DELETE FROM session WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM session ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1000000);`\n\n3. **Verify the New Maximum ID**:\n   - Run the query:  \n     `SELECT MAX(id) FROM session;`  \n     Result: `2146483647`\n\nThis procedure temporarily resolves the issue with `airflow-web` by clearing a large number of session records.\n

perhaps we can just make available to bundles the info about what executor the TI is running with and the bundle can make its own decisions about how to behave

We need to merge v2-10-test (with fast-forward) now - in order to remove last "pull_request_target" workflow from v2-10-stable. @kaxil @utkarsharma2 @jscheffl -> This means that we need to merge stable before preparing 2.10.5 or 2.11.0 -> so that might change a bit the process of releasing - but for security reasons, we should do it now.
Issue #45587: Labels: type:new-feature, area:UI
I have currently utilised the Run status colour which closely aligns with the pool slot options. Reason to that is, run status colours are used all over the UI from a single source of truth(airflow/ui/src/utils/stateColor.ts). Just to not confuse users I kept the same colours of that.\r\n\r\nThe stateColor currently used are:\r\n```\r\nexport const stateColor = {\r\n  deferred: "mediumpurple",\r\n  failed: "red",\r\n  null: "lightblue",\r\n  queued: "gray",\r\n  removed: "lightgrey",\r\n  restarting: "violet",\r\n  running: "lime",\r\n  scheduled: "tan",\r\n  skipped: "hotpink",\r\n  success: "green",\r\n  up_for_reschedule: "turquoise",\r\n  up_for_retry: "gold",\r\n  upstream_failed: "orange",\r\n};\r\n```\r\nOne advantage of this would be when users will personalise the status colours of runs (https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/1.10.13/howto/customize-state-colors-ui.html) these values will also change.\r\n\r\nIf we should have a fixed colour, we can  use the below options: (Open to discussion)\r\n```\r\nOpen Slots\t     Green\r\nScheduled Slots\t     Gray\t\r\nRunning Slots\t     Blue\t\r\nQueued Slots\t     Orange\r\nOccupied Slots\t     Yellow\t\r\nDeferred Slots\t     Red\t\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich would look like\r\n<img width="1725" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-12 at 4 01 20\u202fPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fda2655-45d7-48ce-86b7-60f92620787e" />

Issue #45562: Labels: area:serialization
I addressed your comments but I also added something new. It was actually a suggestion from @dstandish that I think is a great idea! I introduced the concept of `AssetWatcher` that is a thin wrapper around trigger. Explanations:\r\n\r\nInstead of having:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrigger = FileTrigger(....)\r\nasset = Asset("<my_queue>", watchers=[trigger])\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow it is:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrigger = FileTrigger(....)\r\nasset = Asset("<my_queue>", watchers=[AssetWatcher(name="my_queue_watcher", trigger=trigger)])\r\n```\r\n\r\n`AssetWatcher` does not add much besides just a name, but I think it is important because, in the future, we might want to surface the relations between assets and triggers in the graph view in the UI. Representing a trigger in the graph can be tricky because triggers have 2 pieces of information: `classpath` and `kwargs`. None of them are very suitable for displaying purposes. `classpath` is debatable but it is anyway not representable of the trigger. Example: you might have an asset with 2 watchers: each one uses the trigger `FileTrigger` to monitor a different file. Having only the classpath displayed will not help the user to understand which one is which. Hence the name.

Hey here. I know this one is huge and difficult to review, but this was the easiest way I could bring the  "pull_request_target" removal to `v2-10-test`  branch. \r\n\r\nSince we stopped cherry-picking breeze changes to `v2-10-test` and made a LOT of chenges in main (removing Python 3.8, moving providers, adding test_sdk and so on -  cherry-picking individual commits was not an option. So I choose a different path - I copuied the latest `breeze`, `ci_scripts`, `Dockerfiles` and `.pre-commits` and adapted them to`v2-10-test` - mostly removing stuff that was not needed in v2-10-test (providers, charts, new api etc. etc., adding back Python 3.8). \r\n\r\nAll other changes were results of fixing the tests.\r\n\r\nI think the easiest way to review it is two-fold:\r\n\r\n1) you can compare all the breeze/ci stuff with `main` - and see the differences (mostly removals of the things above) \r\n2) then you can compare "airflow" and "tests" with `v2-10-test` and see that they only changed to accomodate to some tests scripts changes. \r\n\r\nI know I am asking a lot, but this is the easiest way we can remove last remnants of `pull_request_target" - which is still a potential security issue.

This allows me to test something like:\r\n```\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.models.baseoperator import BaseOperator\r\nfrom airflow.sdk import dag\r\nfrom airflow.sdk import Variable\r\n\r\n\r\nclass CustomOperator(BaseOperator):\r\n    def execute(self, context):\r\n        value = Variable.get(key="my_var")\r\n        print(f"The variable value is: {value}")\r\n\r\n\r\n@dag()\r\ndef var_from_defn():\r\n    CustomOperator(task_id="hello")\r\n\r\n\r\nvar_from_defn()\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantage is that now this can be used at task level as well at DAG parsing level.\r\n\r\nThe PR is pre mature, will add edge cases etc once we are OK with the general direction.

Hi, @Prab-27. My bad, I should not have kept this issue unassigned. This issue involves porting [secret_masker functionality](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/9ba279d15f26088400b15281b3cc346e2d7a0e30/airflow/utils/log/secrets_masker.py#L147) to the Task SDK, which is part of [AIP-72](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-72+Task+Execution+Interface+aka+Task+SDK) and would involve making some design choices.\r\n\r\nSince we are at a time crunch for Airflow 3.0, I am assigning it to Amogh, Ash & I since it would involve a lot of discussion. Thank you though for your willingness to pick it up.

Yes. That is quite possible edge case though rather infrequent. I am not sure if there is a way we could protect it - we would likely have to add lock on dag not only on DagRun, but it would likely heavily decrease some parallelism scenarios for scheduling. @ashb  wdyt ?

I don‚Äôt remember the details, but from the things mocked, it looks like we changed when we filter files/folders from a scan to check whether a file actually contains a DAG later in the manager, making the mocks now useless (because they are no longer called at this part of the code). All of the mocks simply forces the manager to treat a Python file as one containing a DAG and not drop it prematurely.

Hi @bugraoz93,  \r\n\r\nIf I may suggest, this could also be achieved by using a command-line-specific `audience` in the JWT. Once the new `action_logging` decorator is applied to FastAPI, the audit log logic could be handled in a single API call.  \r\nThis approach could also reduce the chances of missing audit logs. For instance, if the CLI is forcibly terminated right after calling the core API and before the audit log API is invoked, the audit log might not be recorded.  \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\ncc @pierrejeambrun  @vincbeck \r\n

I still have some tests to fix, but this one should be generally ready to review. There is a corresponding #45261 "regular PR" (this is canary build equivalent).\r\n\r\nIt should be **HUGE** simplificaiton of our CI workflows and Dockerfile -> and huge improvement in security - as we are getting rid of the `pull_request_target` workflow.\r\n\r\nI am planning to backport that one to `v2-10-test` and `providers-fab/v1-5` so that we will be able to get rid of the `pull_request_target` workflows altogether.
Issue #45265: Labels: area:UI
@jscheffl \r\n\r\nYaa, In starting I thought to add this as private endpoint for UI.\r\nBut we have a option to do it from CLI.\r\nSo, thought to be consistent and add public API.\r\n\r\nAlso, regarding the static checks, I tried running it locally. It suggesting me to change the name of `ImportVariableBody` to `Body_import_variables`, Not sure, why there is constraint to change it.

Issue #45260: Labels: area:dev-tools, changelog:skip, area:lineage
\r\nWhen attempting to remove the lineage logic from the core module, I noticed that it causes failures in tests related to **OpenLineage listener capturing hook-level lineage** (https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41482).  \r\n\r\nFor example, removing `apply_lineage` and `prepare_lineage` from `BaseOperator`:  \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/0efd9e6a2fa8bde0f6c14e88951b44badca063a2/airflow/models/baseoperator.py#L705-L739  \r\n\r\nResults in the following test failure:  \r\n```\r\nFAILED providers/tests/openlineage/extractors/test_manager.py::test_extractor_manager_gets_data_from_pythonoperator - assert 0 == 1\r\n +  where 0 = len([])\r\n +    where [] = HookLineage(inputs=[], outputs=[]).outputs\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/0efd9e6a2fa8bde0f6c14e88951b44badca063a2/providers/tests/openlineage/extractors/test_manager.py#L301  \r\n\r\nIt seems OpenLineage is still coupled with the lineage module and might need to be moved to `compact.lineage` for now (or to the OpenLineage module in a future PR ).  \r\n\r\nAfter some experimentation, implementing an `on_load` callback in the `OpenLineageProviderPlugin` to monkey-patch the core module at runtime prevents the OpenLineage test failures, even with the lineage module removed from the core. \r\n> Based on https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/authoring-and-scheduling/plugins.html#interface\r\n\r\nI‚Äôm not sure if this is a suitable long-term solution for maintaining OpenLineage compatibility while cleaning up the lineage module ?\r\n\r\ncc @Lee-W @uranusjr  \r\n

Issue #45050: Labels: kind:bug, area:core, needs-triage
I think your proposal is meaningful - whereas I am wondering what problems with Postgres are leading to this in-consistency. I think this should be addressed first. (1) You should check how to make your DB stable. If there are connection losses in other places I think a lot of more errors can happen. Airflow expects a stable DB. (2) I am wondering why in this cause you report an inconsistent result is left in the DB - I would have expected that all steps are executed in one transaction. Means either not any updates or a consistent update.

Yes, you are right, I can re-produce this problem also with Airflow 2.10.4. It seems the "onBlur()" event in the UI does not trigger correctly if you leave the field. It _should_ update the JSON entry box on leaving the field focus with the newly added data.\r\nInterestingly the other CodeMirror views do not have this problem.

Nice .. I like the idea. Tried to do similar thing to `common.sql` with stubgen (after initial attempt of doing it similarly to you) - but this explicit approach is I think better - even if requires more code. \r\n\r\nOne other option I saw in Android OS (and maybe that is a good idea for you to explore) - was to turn the signatures into a plain-text file where you keep signatures of public methods - and keep it in the repository next to the code. Then you do not have to check-out the previous version of the code (Which is not always available - in CI we only retrieve single commit and we do not have parent commit by default) - you just generate a new version of such signature "dump" file - then pre-commit framework will automatically see that the dump has changed and will fail precommit  (and you would have to commit such modifed file to accept  changed signatures)

Task flow operators do not have templateable field at all - so it does not make sense to add it there. And in task flow task you can simply call a Python function from inside the decorated function - there is no need to pass callable to the taskflow parameter if you can call them directly. This request makes no sense.

I seriously doubt this is a problem Airflow uses the same resolution mechanism in consistent order.\r\n\r\nMost likely what was different is that you had DIFFERENT configuration in two places where things were running.

BTW: @ashb @kaxil -> while this should fix the test, I wonder if this is our concern that stdout /stderr might come in different order than they were produced. That is generally I think quite impossible to prevent if you have parallel threads reading from two different pipees, the only "practical" way I know is to make sure both stdout and stderr are joined as single stderr+out pipe by the process that produces them. So i am not sure if there is anything we can do here if we want to keep the stdout/stderr separation. \r\n\r\nThat\

I think you need to provide a bit more information. Windows/WSL2 is not really a target platform for airflow runtime for "production" and we do not run any tests with it.\r\n\r\nBut maybe - if you can do some analysis and provide more information we can attempt to help you in your problem. \r\n\r\nYou can try to gather some more logs and information - i.e. gather more detailed logs from example tasks - to see which processes have been created - if you look and trace it in the logs and send us the info, maybe we can help you to figure out some workarounds. Track what processes are being created. Also if you are using `run_as_user` - feature, there might be a problem with WSL2 or your impersonation user settings.\r\n\r\nThere few parameters you can try - https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#execute-tasks-new-python-interpreter might be something worth trying. \r\n\r\nConverting to a discussion, as Windows/WSL2 is not a target runtime platform - but there might be a discussion coming out of it.

One important thing is not only the download but also the FileTaskHandler must 1:1 stream the logs from the backend, else it will go OOM as well.\r\n\r\nThis included when I took a look last time... why actually log sorting and merging is implemented in general I doubt the usefulness because I also had situations where log sorting by timestamp gave "strange" results. In my view logs should not be modified/sorted/merged when served from webserver. This would also remove the OOM problem in general... whereas I have seen situations as well where the browser/client "dies" in rendering. So a limit in logs provided to browser might be a important feature as well (but please not like Github is doing it)

One comment here @omkar-foss.  This is quite some change in how we treat errors, so it would be great to announce intention to implement those error numbers and messages at the devlist. While there was survey and few people discussed that this is a good idea, "What did not happen on devlist, did not happen" - so likely start a discussion on devlist - with intention to run lazy consensus / (or vote in case there will be any doubts).

I think that one calls for "joining" - seems that `_get_task_map_length` is only used in `get_task_map_length` really - - so we should just remove the `_get_task_map_length` and move all the code to `get_task_map_length`

Hi @potiuk While I like the cleanup and reversion of AIP-44 you are running faster than I can make the other PR to main to move EdgeExecutor off the AIP-44.\r\n\r\nThe method map is broken on main and for Airflow 3 can be completely removed. BUT we need it further for the backcompat case in Airflow 2.10. There I need to restore the state of Airflow 2.10, else it is both broken in Airflow 2.10 as well as in Airflow 3.\r\n\r\nWhile I accept it is temporarily broken in Airflow 3 (Still running behind trying to make EdgeExecutor working on main (again after the stone was hitting the glass) with the ongoing changes and merges to EdgeExecutor it is also throwing stones on the ability to further use it in Airflow 2.10.

Hi, are we planning on also emitting the lineage events from Airflow itself? I think we have other services that emit lineage (for example, BigQuery) where we also still emit this lineage from Airflow. For example, in Composer, we generate the events based on the SQL query of Hive, SparkSQL, Presto and Trino jobs.

I don‚Äôt know about the new implementation, but in the Connextion implementation, the result _is_ actually sorted, but it‚Äôs against a very weird default (`id`) that isn‚Äôt really deterministic in the tests because when you insert things through the ORM it‚Äôs not guaranteed the `id` would be the same as the order you insert them (due to both database and ORM implementation). So the tests will need fixing in any case unless we change the default.

Comment - I believe in Airflow 3 we are going to always use structured logging - so I think that one will be possible to implement - at least theorethically. @ashb @kaxil - but for remote logs it might also need some changes to the APIs.

The (2) sounds like a really good idea (not for all callbacks though). It would be great to see callbacks as implicit "tasks" in Airflow UI. Though not all callbacks can be done this way I am afraid. "on_retry" and "on execute" are particularly not fitting the "teardown" concept. The "on_execute" might be an implicit "setup" task, but "on_retry" is a bit problematic\r\n

Interesting.

Hi @pierrejeambrun, @ephraimbuddy,\r\n\r\nI‚Äôve refactored the `_UniqueConstraintErrorHandler` to provide unified error details across all database dialects by parsing errors with `re2`. If the parsing fails, it defaults to returning the original database error.\r\n\r\nI‚Äôve also added tests for the unique constraint handler, covering the following cases:\r\n- Inserting a duplicate entry for a single-column unique constraint (e.g., `Pool`, `Variable`).\r\n- Inserting a duplicate entry for a multi-column unique constraint (e.g., `dag_id` and `run_id` pair in `DagRun`).\r\n- Handling cases where parsing the database error message fails.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your feedback and suggestions!\r\n

I am cherry-picking that one to 2-10-test - targetting for 2.10.4 - just in case https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/10958 will not be quickly resolved and Pydantic team will be reluctant to make `eval-type-backport` as required dependency for Pydantic (which IMHO is the best solution to the problem they introduced in Pydantic 2.10.*. This is not ideal as it only protects the 2.10.4 users on Python 3.8/3.9 but I want to have it handy.

Nope. This is still very wrong. "common" sql provider should not know anything about "oracle" - this is the main reason why we introduced "common.sql" and all the "database" specific calls should come to the provider - so you have to modify it in the way that all "oracle" specific code lives in the "oracle" provider. You should implement a new feature in the common.sql where you can replace the template and then make oracle provider to replace it.

> Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nYes. The only way we can do this approved is if you figure how how to run that code ONLY in task - and NOT in scheduler. Running any DAG Author provided code in scheduler is violating basic Airlfow security model https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/security/security_model.html - and Airflow Scheduler should never run DAG Author modifiable code. \r\n\r\nThis is for example why custom scheduler code is done via Plugins - you are not able to create custom scheduler code via DAG - you have to have plugin installed.\r\n\r\nI think it\

Maybe should we also just model `cherry-picker`being a dependency in breeze that this is automatically installed when setting up breeze? :-D\r\n\r\nI think that is mostly an "external" dependency that should be use outside of breeze and independently which environment you are in.  If you install it with `breeze` it will shadow the one that you have installed with `uv tool` or `pipx`. Not sure if that is what we want :)

Yes. `pip install -e .[EXTRA]` effectively run inside should be replaced with `uv venv` followed with appropriate `uv sync --extra EXTRA`. This is a left-over after `uv` becoming recommended tool and adding `provider` and `task_sdk`. \r\n\r\nShould be a nice first-time issue.

As mentioned earlier, I‚Äôm not certain if there would be a meaningful difference since `pendulum.parse()` already supports the `ISO 8601` format.\r\n\r\n> * datetime.datetime:\r\nA Python datetime.datetime.\r\nIn requests and responses will be represented as a str in ISO 8601 format, like: 2008-09-15T15:53:00+05:00.\r\n\r\nhttps://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/extra-data-types/?h=datet#other-data-types

Could you please update the PR title? The current one is a bit vague and doesn‚Äôt clearly communicate the purpose of the change. I recommend reading [this blog post](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) for guidance.\r\n\r\nIn particular, it would be helpful to follow this principle:\r\n\r\n> **_A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence: ‚ÄúIf applied, this commit will [your subject line here].‚Äù_**\r\n\r\nSince this entry will appear in the release notes, it‚Äôs important that the PR title and description clearly explain the changes and their impact.

I don‚Äôt think we are moving core Airflow concepts like BaseOperator into the provider? Unless we are, at least `@task` should stay in core. Likely `@setup` and `@teardown` as well (since `as_setup()` and `as_teardown()` are on BaseOperator).

OK. I moved it here from https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/43965 .\r\n\r\nThat one should be ready for review. I got it green, all the tests are nicely split between core and providers. I will be adding a little more diagnostics (Right now it is not obvious if the successful tests are doing what they are supposed to do) and running it for all versions of Python etc. to check that everythong is as expected + I will add runnig system tests - but other than that, I think it is in the shape that is pretty much ready to merge (and for sure ready to review).\r\n\r\nLeter we can run a number optimizations, but the way it is and after I check it for all typos and run in multiple versions, we should be ready to go.

Hi @pierrejeambrun, \r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on the current `filter_param_factory` implementation? The current approach adds a new parameter, `_type`, to specify the type of query parameter at runtime. This implementation consolidates multiple factories like `str_filter_param_factory`, `str_list_filter_param_factory`, etc., into a single `filter_param_factory`.\r\n\r\nI have checked the OpenAPI schema at `http://localhost:29091/docs`, and the correct type is displayed in the documentation. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to your feedback!\r\n

Hey @jason810496,\r\n\r\nThat‚Äôs a good question, and I‚Äôm glad you raised it! @rawwar and I had a similar discussion, and it seems we all have similar concerns.\r\n\r\nAt first, I thought keeping `"List Jobs"` and `"List Jobs with Filters"` as separate endpoints made sense for clarity. But after thinking it through more and taking a closer look, I believe combining them into a single "List Jobs" endpoint with optional query parameters for filters might be a better approach. This way, the endpoint would return all jobs by default, with filtering options (as a `QueryParameter`) as needed. It would make it both straightforward and easy to maintain.\r\n\r\nThanks for raising this! I am happy to keep the discussion going if others have thoughts on this approach. Otherwise, let‚Äôs go ahead and merge it into one endpoint.\r\n\r\ncc: @josix @rawwar

> I am not an K8s expert, can init containers run in parallel? Or are they executed serial?\r\nHow about if init containers run for a longer time? Would it be interesting to stream logs while they are running to see progress? And if they run in parallel would it mix logs?\r\n\r\nEach init container runs sequentially, with each one waiting for the previous container to complete. The main containers wait until all init containers are ready before starting.\r\n\r\nRef: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/#understanding-init-containers\r\n\r\n> Init containers are exactly like regular containers, except:\r\n> * Init containers always run to completion.\r\n> * Each init container must complete successfully before the next one starts.\r\n

It seems the default filters in cluster activity add 1 hour to current time as `end_date`. I am not sure if the same needs to be done in new UI since it presents preset hours like last 1 hour, 8 hours etc. for now where `end_date` has to be current time in the UI. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/6d85a0466d91d501af87c8904b902ea92cee466d/airflow/www/static/js/cluster-activity/useFilters.tsx#L52-L59

Hi @pierrejeambrun, here is the update:\r\n\r\n### Common `Accept` Header for JSON and Text\r\nI have added `HeaderAcceptJsonOrText` in `common/headers.py`, annotated with `Mimetype` from `common/types.py`. \r\n\r\nI tested it with `application/json; charset=utf-8`, and for headers including `utf-8`, we need to use `startswith` to match the header correctly. Additionally, I included an OpenAPI schema for the `Accept` header.\r\n

@Lee-W @uranusjr When working on it I realized that assets are added in the DB from DAG definition but never removed (or at least I did not see the code). Meaning, as a DAG author if I define an asset in my DAG and then later on remove it, the asset is never removed from the DB. Am I wrong? If not, is it intended?

Should not that capacity be a task parameter rather than executor config parameter on DAG level. We have similar concept with `pool_slots` and there they are "per task" - and part of the BaseOperator. It seems to be way more flexible to specify it this way (additionally then this could be renamed as "task_slots"  - to be similar to "pool_slots") or maybe even we should combine the two. This way it will also be potentially usable by other executors.

I encountered a very similar issue in Airflow 2.10.1 with apache-airflow-providers-amazon==8.28.0. However, in my case, I was running Airflow in a Docker container (Docker Compose), not using MWAA, and the logs missing from the Airflow UI were the first few from each of my ECS tasks. These logs were present in the ECS task CloudWatch log streams. Adding a 10 second `sleep` statement before the `logger.info` calls as a workaround caused those logs to appear as expected in the Airflow UI. All of this held true for a few separate `EcsRunTaskOperator` steps calling different ECS tasks.

I will also add a separate test to test sytem tests in CI as part of it, so that it will not happen in the future

@dstandish I think this endpoint is deleted in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/43496. Deleting them should fix CI test issues but I wanted to double-check with you. I am not sure how we are going to handle the permissions and tests in the FastAPI so maybe deleting them would be a good idea for now.

I also tested a few scenarios where we were switching between "breeze static checks" and "git commit" pre-commit as I noticed that they could be using different pre-commit installation, and they could make no use of the "pre-commit-uv" - I fixed it in this PR, and now also users will get warning if their pre-commit is installed without `uv` and they also will get instructions how to install it.

Issue #43604: Labels: area:dev-tools
Just to copy a bit more context on this change:\r\n\r\nMy - very basic and long term assumption for our local dev environment is that while ``uv`` makes it (and it will only get better) to maintain, upgrade, sync and setup the environment  very easily and the UX is great and complexity is low, we do not want to EXCLUSIVELY have setup that only works with UV\r\n\r\nI think everything that works with uv should also be achievable (even if in a much more convoluted way) with the standard tooling that is managed by PSF-managed tools (pip , hatch etc.) .\r\n\r\nWhile I love Astral, they are VC-backed company that will expect some returns of investment, and while I believe they are great community member and have no evil goals, they might get acquired, or whatever at any time, and we do not want to have a ‚Äústrong‚Äù dependency on their tooling being available forever.\r\n\r\nThis goes in line with ASF‚Äôs ‚Äúplan for 50 years‚Äù tools dependency approach - use what‚Äôs available and makes you more productive, but don‚Äôt rely too much on anything you cannot exchange easily. Sooner or later EVERY vendor we work with will disappear, and we must be there.\r\n\r\nThat‚Äôs why this doc has two chapters ‚Äúrecommended with UV‚Äù and ‚Äúhere is how you can do it with pip‚Äù\r\n\r\nI also removed hatch - for simplicity - we do not want to describe 3 tools, also I removed plyvel as dependency as it is almost impossible to install it MacOs and it blocked --all-extras and --devel extras to be installed for MacOS\r\n\r\nAll the rest might fail when installing - and you might need to have some system dependencies but they should be ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to install with brew and others\r\n\r\nPlyvel has a long time history of breaking MacOS and 10.15 is famously broken now https://github.com/wbolster/plyvel/issues/114\r\n\r\nAlso ``uv.lock`` is excluded for now until we figure out if /how to keep it updated acrooss all ~700 dependencies of ours and how to join it with the constraints we produce.

I have a (maybe/probably) crazy idea that might make our tests nicer, and easier to parallelize in future:\r\n\r\nIf we use dependency overrides, we can make the session inside our routers use the same session https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/testing-dependencies/#use-the-appdependency_overrides-attribute\r\n\r\nBut for now: lets set up this dep override and change the `commit()` in tests to `flush()` (possibly putting the flush inside the dag_maker fixture itself?)

Issue #43515: Labels: provider:google, area:providers
Hi @shervinrad100, Thank you for the contribution.\r\n\r\nFor the Google provider (and also Airflow in general), we are following a depreciation policy which states that before removal (which requires a major version bump), we need to deprecate the `public` parameters/hooks/operators etc. While adding the depreciation, we also need to mention the **removal date** _(if possible alternative things to use)_.\r\n\r\nNormally, we have a hook to use it for depreciation but parameter depreciation is a bit tricky. Here is an example for depreciation for the parameter.\r\n```python\r\nwarnings.warn("Something is deprecated and will be removed after MONTH DD, YYYY. Please use something else instead."

I moved it to "Debugging Improvements" project @RNHTTR -> the result of the debugging survey prepared by @omkar-foss and team has been turned into a number of action points discussed there and I strongly feel (if you agree with me) that this one falls into the same "bucket". So far we are only discussing what could be done there and there are few small things implemented, but possibly that one should go there as well.

Since last run info is also added I guess the tooltip is needed there too with duration instead of next dag run creation time. This PR could be updated to have two components in DagRunInfo.tsx\r\n\r\n*  `NextDagRunInfo` that receives next_data_interval_start, next_data_interval_end and next_dagrun_create_after .\r\n* `LastDagRunInfo` that receives data_interval_start, data_interval_end and duration .\r\n\r\nThoughts?

Sure. That should be a simple change to selective checks.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/43498 output (particularly in Bulid Info/ Selective checks) : https://github.com/apache/airflow/actions/runs/11237464231/job/31239971306?pr=42779 at the output you will see this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67e478d6-ac36-4ccd-bc8d-b9e775fd4096)\r\n\r\nAnd then the reason why tests is that we cannot determine which tests to run in case only "new UI files change" :\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd036790-ddb6-43cf-bbdf-38c2072fd7d9)\r\n\r\nWe simply have no check to see if only new UI changed . Generally the approach we have is that we handled all the "known" files and depending on a file type we classify it - and if there are any change to  files we have no idea about, we run "all tests" - just in case.\r\n\r\nIt happens here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/4fc16f154d2a159dd52955b40d5ef440d3d82425/dev/breeze/src/airflow_breeze/utils/selective_checks.py#L804\r\n\r\nSo the thing is ere that we should just add additional check here and if files changed match "UI files" - they should be added as "all_ui_files" and removed when we calculate remaining files. Then remaining files will be 0 and in turn only "Always" tests will run rather than all files.\r\n\r\nWe could also add the test case here https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/4fc16f154d2a159dd52955b40d5ef440d3d82425/dev/breeze/tests/test_selective_checks.py#L853 to test that case.\r\n\r\nIf anyone would like to implement it- happy to review  :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

Issue #43484: Labels: kind:feature, area:core, airflow3.x candidate
Since this would be adding functionality, I think this is a feature request and not a bug. I think skipping the task instance whose `end_date` is passed makes sense.\r\n\r\nTo work around this, would it make sense to remove the deprecated task from the Dag? Also, the `logical_date` is already available via [task instance context](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/templates-ref.html#variables).

I assume this is correct.\r\n\r\nThe term "object" in the JSON schema validation we run refers to "dict" object types. See: https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.\r\n\r\nSo in your case you need to define it as `array`. Note that empty arrays in the UI form are always triggered with `none` value... there was also a ticket open for this to discuss how the form shall handle empty fields...

Issue #43408: Labels: area:helm-chart
Hello @koustreak  - could you please explain how are you going to provide synchronization between multiple repos?\r\n\r\nOne of the functionalities of git-sync is that it performs atomic swap when new commits are synced - it keeps the old repository, while it checks-out the new one and then atomically swaps the new folder with the old one via symbolic link.\r\n\r\nThis is an important feature of git-sync, because it guarantees that DAG parsing across multiple folders inside the repo is consistent - and uses always the same single-consistent version of the DAG files and any related imports.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the reasons why both git-sync and us are reluctant to manage and sync multiple repositories via "external means" - because you can already do it via "submodules" - and then the consistency and atomic swap is maintained - while you get  a good way of keeping references to all the updated repos and even reverting and backing individual repos to previous versions in the single "umbrella repo" using submodules.\r\n\r\nWith the approach you propose, not only you have multiple init containers, and running containers with git-sync, but also they have somewhat unpredictible schedule - and it\

Actually - this is not correct/complete - is really a breaking change. \r\n\r\nSo far PythonVirtualenv operator used `virtualenv` package to create the venvs, not the built-in `venv` module.  Also there is a dedicated `[virtualenv]` extra to install the package. The package is here: https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/\r\n\r\nNote that virtualenv is stil maintained till today, even if venv became available \r\n\r\nThis is mostly due to historical reasons, but also because `virtualenv` created venv behaves slightly differently than the built-in venv one (one of the differences for example is that it cannot be relocatable).\r\n\r\nI do not think we are bound to any specifics of `venv` vs `virtualenv` - however when customers use PythonVirtualenvOperat (and `virtualenv` under the hood) they might rely on some internals and differences of `virtualenv` vs `venv`.\r\n\r\nSo while I sympathise with the change - since `venv` is now built-in in Python since 3.3 - I think a change to use `venv` instead of `virtualenv` needs to be discussed in devlist, ending up as a potentially breaking change in Airflow 3 and newsfragment.\r\n\r\nAlso this change is plainly wrong - creating virtualenv currently actually uses "virtualenv" command line not `venv` module - so if we accept it as it is, it will check for `venv` but actually will use for `virtualenv`.

Duplicate of #43356 . You have not used constraints https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/installing-from-pypi.html when installing Airflow (please do as we recommend), this is not an airflow issue - this is FAB issue that is already fixed and 2.10.3 will be using the fixed version.

When you are inside virtual env you are not "really" in the context of Airflow. You can not use special Airflow classes with in or better say `AirflowSkipException` has not special meaning inside the virtual env as Airflow does not look inside of it. What you need to do is return specific error code from the Python callable function and Airflow can check this code against what you specify in the `skip_on_exit_code` parameter:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/63ff22f4038f34354dc5807036d1bf10653c2ecd/airflow/operators/python.py#L674-L676\r\n\r\nClosing as this is not a bug.

## Issues identified\r\n\r\nAfter updating the primary key on the `TaskInstance` model to a UUID7 `id` field (from the composite primary key of `["dag_id", "task_id", "run_id", "map_index"]`), I have now run into issues  in testing and session management:\r\n\r\n1. **`session.merge()` Compatibility**  \r\n\r\n    The `session.merge()` function operates strictly on primary keys as mentioned in [this SQLAlchemy docs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/session_state_management.html#merging), which means it no longer recognizes the unique constraint on `["dag_id", "task_id", "run_id", "map_index"]` to identify existing `TaskInstance` records. This leads to issues in cases where `session.merge()` was previously used to either update or insert TaskInstance records, as it now fails to locate the intended record by the unique constraint.\r\n\r\n    Example:\r\n \r\n     https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/b2ecb6c9caacd2ca7a2c1519ca892b19b2bb35fb/tests/models/test_dag.py#L2013-L2026\r\n\r\n    A possible workaround would be to follow `session.merge()` calls with `refresh_from_db()` to ensure the instance has the latest state:  \r\n   ```python\r\n   task_instance_1 = session.merge(TaskInstance(task=t_1, run_id=dagrun_1.run_id, state=ti_state_begin))\r\n   task_instance_1.refresh_from_db()  # Update instance with current DB state\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n\r\n2. **`session.get()` usage with `TaskInstanceKey`**  \r\n\r\n    Similarly, `session.get()` and other primary key-based session operations now rely solely on the `id` UUID rather than the composite fields. This results in errors when accessing or sorting records based on the previous composite fields, as `session.get()` cannot match identifiers to `TaskInstance` records by the unique constraint.\r\n\r\n    **Current code in main**:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/78ff0a99700125121b7f0647023503750f14a11b/tests/models/test_cleartasks.py#L742\r\n\r\n    I have been changing those references from `TaskInstanceKey` in Database calls with `ti.id`, example:\r\n\r\n   https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/cca7ce0fd66b01293e21221d1dd9332312a4cb66/tests/models/test_cleartasks.py#L742\r\n\r\n3. **Airflow REST API calls which filters TIs**  \r\n    \r\n    Similar to (2) above, some of our REST API call filters TI records based on current primary key as below:\r\n     https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/78ff0a99700125121b7f0647023503750f14a11b/airflow/api_connexion/endpoints/task_instance_endpoint.py#L536-L537\r\n\r\n     I am changing that to `session.scalars(select(TI).where(...))..one_or_none()` queries. For example, the above code is changed to the following in this PR.\r\n     https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/3c61ba7157bce0dd9d7456670e7ba553be046d6e/airflow/api_connexion/endpoints/task_instance_endpoint.py#L536-L540

We could look at rich stacktraces. https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/traceback.html - the are already way nicer than regular stack traces with colors, formatting, tables and even displaying local variables for each stack, and ability to suppress frames that we do not want to see. \r\n\r\nI already use them in `breeze`. \r\n\r\nThough there are a bit unfamiliar for Python people and require a bit gettigng used to, they are way more powerful. So likely some examples and discussions on the devlist should happen whether they will be acceptable for us and wheter we would like to have them exposed by default for end users (or maybe it should be somehow controlled)\r\n\r\nSee the blog post from Will - creator of rich with some examples https://www.willmcgugan.com/blog/tech/post/better-python-tracebacks-with-rich/\r\n\r\nBTW. The blog shows very old version of those - the actual traceback that can be produced now are even more powerful

I can recommend this guide from Google about writing good error messages: https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/error-messages. The rest of the courses in that book are also really good btw.\r\n\r\n> an error like `Celery command failed on host` can be transformed or displayed with something like "`Please check your DAG processor timeout variable for this`". \r\n\r\nActionable errors are good, but has to be done very carefully, because if it gives misleading advice it will lead users down chasing the wrong rabbit hole. For example this log in `standard_task_runner.py` is most of the time not due to memory running out:  `"Job %s was killed before it finished (likely due to running out of memory)",`. I\

Talked to Constance earlier; we should probably still make `from airflow.datasets import Dataset` work (and maybe also `from airflow import Dataset`). Without jumping through too many hoops, let‚Äôs just create a mostly empty `airflow/datasets.py` that emits a deprecation warning on import, and add a lazy import entry in `airflow/__init__.py`. Similar to how we handle name deprecations in providers.\r\n\r\nSame for DatasetAlias; this one is not as important (I doubt many people are already using it aside from Cosmos), but we might as well add it since the mechanism is the same.\r\n\r\nThose names should be removed in Airflow 3.2.

Hey, have you been able to see if the `include_full_task_info` [config](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-openlineage/stable/configurations-ref.html#include-full-task-info) introduced in provider 1.10 can help you out? It should limit the number of fields included in the event.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nMy bad. In 1.7 we removed most of large fields from the event by default. In 1.10 we added a config that lets you include them in the event, if you need them (false by default).\r\n\r\nSo the solution here would be to upgrade the OL provider, i think.

While this is cool, I am not sure if we should group them. We have some tooling for release manager that verifies if all "marked" PRs have been cherry-picked to to the release branch and I think it assumes one-pr-per-commit. It would make our automation to show some "false positives" or "false negatives" if we merge several cherry-picks.\r\n\r\nWe use "squash and merge" strategy so PRs are always auto-squashed to single commit.

Issue #42999: Labels: area:CI
cc: @ashb @kaxil @gopidesupavan @romsharon98 @shahar1 @eladkal @jscheffl. \r\n\r\nI am slowly looking at the ways how we can again speed up the CI image build and caching.\r\nOne of the reasons I **thought** caching is not as good is the UV version bump. Whenever we increase the UV version it will invalidate the cache layer **just** before installing airflow from the branch tip.\r\n\r\nStarting from here https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/Dockerfile.ci#L1281\r\n\r\n```Dockefile\r\nARG AIRFLOW_PIP_VERSION=24.2\r\nARG AIRFLOW_UV_VERSION=0.4.22\r\nARG AIRFLOW_USE_UV="true"\r\n\r\nRUN echo "Airflow version: ${AIRFLOW_VERSION}"\r\n\r\n# Copy all scripts required for installation - changing any of those should lead to\r\n# rebuilding from here\r\nCOPY --from=scripts install_packaging_tools.sh install_airflow_dependencies_from_branch_tip.sh \\\r\n    common.sh /scripts/docker/\r\nRUN bash /scripts/docker/install_packaging_tools.sh; \\\r\n    if [[ ${AIRFLOW_PRE_CACHED_PIP_PACKAGES} == "true" ]]; then \\\r\n        bash /scripts/docker/install_airflow_dependencies_from_branch_tip.sh; \\\r\n    fi\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen we change default UV_VERSION - all the layers below that get invalidated - so the COPY that copies the script and installing dependencies from the `main` branch tip will run again and reinstalling of the whole airlfow from "main" branch runs from scratch. Even with `uv` where it is as fast as possible, it takes 180s on my machine (3 minutes) - which is pretty slow. And the only reason in this case is that we changed the UV version.\r\n\r\nI think about optimizing it a bit - since UV version is changing so fast - maybe we can optimize it  by installing "latest" version of UV for the "branch tip" installation and only then install the "fixed" version of UV.\r\n\r\nWe are fixing UV version in order to get stability in place - there is a risk that UV upgrade will break things (happened in the past) as they are "moving fast and break things". So fixing UV in the image (and manual updates and merging after PR passes) makes sense - but for the optimisation purpose, it might make sense that branch tip installation is happening with latest UV without specifying version.\r\n\r\nThis should be generally quite save and stable. The "install_airlfow_from_branch_tip" is only optimization of installation - preinstalling airflow from "some" good version of airflow. If we do not change UV_VERSION before it, the layer would usually not get invalidated for builds - because there is nothing that could trigger the invalidation (no other previous Dockerfile lines would change) - so once such a build succeeds in main and the remote cache is updated, it will NOT reinstall uv with latest version - it will keep the uv installed in the same version it succeed last time - because the cache will not get invalidated.\r\n\r\nSo the first time when the cache will be build it will roughly work this way:\r\n\r\n1) install latest UV version\r\n2) install airlfow from the latest main branch (this takes 3 minutes)\r\n3) fix UV to the version (say 0.4.22) and install it\r\n4) COPY airflow sources\r\n5) proceed with installing airlfow from sources (incremental)\r\n \r\nThen whenever we have modified airflow sources - for all the subsequent image build operations, if base python version and no Dockerfile above those line change and no UV version change - it will reuse the cache effectively:\r\n\r\n1) -> from cache\r\n2) -> from cache \r\n3) -> from cache\r\n4) COPY airflow sources\r\n5) proceed with installing airlfow from sources (incremental)\r\n\r\nIf we update UV to 0.4.23 for example\r\n\r\n1) -> from cache\r\n2) -> from cache (this is where we save 3 minutes) \r\n3) fix UV to the version (say 0.4.23) and install it\r\n4) COPY airflow sources\r\n5) proceed with installing airlfow from sources (incremental)\r\n\r\nThis means that we are saving 3 minutes for rebuilds of CI image (locally and on CI) - when only UV version change.\r\n\r\nWDYT? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

No. That is generally bad idea to have `tests_common`  in `dev` (and this case shows why).\r\n\r\nDev is indeed replaced in CI when images - in "checkout target commit":\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n        echo\r\n        echo -e "\\033[33m Replace scripts, dev, actions with target branch for non-committer builds!\\033[0m"\r\n        echo\r\n        rm -rfv "scripts/ci"\r\n        rm -rfv "dev"\r\n        rm -rfv ".github/actions"\r\n        rm -rfv ".github/workflows"\r\n        mv -v "target-airflow/scripts/ci" "scripts"\r\n        mv -v "target-airflow/dev" "."\r\n        mv -v "target-airflow/.github/actions" "target-airflow/.github/workflows" ".github"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is for security reason, so that any of the "dev" scripts that are used during CI and build process are not tampered with when they are modified in the incoming PR.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit of a teething problem after #42505 and you were the unlucky first non-committer who attempted to modify common test code that is shared between providers and airflow.\r\n\r\n@ashb - we will have to find better place for "tests_common" than `dev` - because otherwise every non-commiter who wants to make a PR changing the "common" code they will get their "dev/tests_common" code overwritten.\r\n\r\nGenerally "dev" was always supposed to be used for "build scripts" but never by "test code".\r\n\r\nHow about just "tests_common" at the top level of the repository @ashb ?\r\n

@potiuk \r\n\r\nHello\r\nThis is the PR I wrote again because I sent the wrong PR last time. Can you check it? Thank you (related PR : https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/42778)\r\n

Why? Can you explain? What is source documentation?\r\n\r\nCan you please add a unit test to cover this change?
Issue #42944: Labels: area:providers, area:dev-tools, provider:apache-beam
Good that you checked. The sdist package to wheel conversion did not work before with Python3.12. \n\nAs explained few times before when you asked -this was the reason for having the exclusion. I have not checked if it works now it could be caused by other packages that failed with 3.12.\n\nAnother reason why it might start working -I think - the version of Beam released a week or so  ago could have fixed the sdist failure - because they generally fixed some dependencies in latest version released while I was on vacations.\n\nIf my hypothesis is right - If you want to see how it failed before you can pin the beam package to the previous version and see the failure.\n\nIf you can confirm that it works now - we can remove the limitation.

Actualyt now, when I think of it - quarantining is not enough /not needed - what we really need is to not have mssql integration running in CI. \r\n\r\nIf you look at selective checks -> they produce the list of "testable_integrations" : https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/breeze/src/airflow_breeze/utils/selective_checks.py#L1298\r\n\r\nDefined here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/breeze/src/airflow_breeze/global_constants.py#L57\r\n\r\nThis list is produced by selective checks here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/actions/runs/11226083287/job/31205948119?pr=42811#step:8:824\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd used in the workflow that runs integration tests to produce matrix of jobs:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml#L67\r\n\r\nSo all we need to do is to remove mssql from the list.\r\n\r\nThis is actually cool - because this way you can still run the tests locally:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbreeze tessting integration-tests --integration mssql \r\n```\r\n\r\nbut they will not run in CI. \r\n\r\n\r\n

This might or might not work, because we have not yet released standard provider - so some part of the CI (when released PyPI packages are used) might fail. It might require from us to release a pre-release version of the "standard" provider in PyPI.\r\n\r\nThis will work nicely because pre-release version will be installed by `pip` (as I understand it) - when no "released" version is available and we use it as dependency (@uranusjr ? - am I right?) - but regular users will not see it as released in PyPI and we do not have to worry about release process for standard, we can just prepare the package and upload it to PyPI as dev0, dev1 etc.

Issue #42612: Labels: area:Scheduler, area:webserver, area:serialization, kind:documentation, area:db-migrations
The addition of `name` to Asset makes the unique constraint more complex because we want to keep history of different name-URI combinations. For example, if you have two assets (in the history of the Airflow deployment) at the same S3 location, but used for different purposes, we want to keep the two distinct for history purposes. Conversely, if an asset name is linked to different URIs, we want to keep thw entries distinct too. This means the unique constraint on Asset should be against the `(name, uri)` combination.\r\n\r\nHowever, during one DAG-processing round, we also want to keep one name only used once‚Äîotherwise it would be extremely confusing if the user accidentally uses the same name to represent different assets in different DAGs. So we also need to have a unique constraint _only on name if an asset is active_. This is possible with Postgres with `create unique index ... on asset (name) WHERE (is_orphaned = false)`, but not anywhere else. This is what the new table is for‚Äîwhen an asset is in use, it has an entry in AssetActive, and that table enforces uniqueness on `name` (and `uri`, same problem) individually. This essentially also replaces `is_orphaned` (an orphaned asset will not have a corresponding entry in AssetActive), so `is_orphaned` is removed.

Issue #42595: Labels: kind:feature, area:API, AIP-84
I mentioned in the main epic how we want to refactor this endpoint. I think we can have `graph_data` handle all of the task order and structure as I mentioned in #42367. Then we can simplify `grid_data` to only include dag run history. Each dag run includes an array of all its task instances. \n\nAlso, it would be nice to calculate summaries of mapped tasks and task groups (determine the overall state, give a breakdown of counts of children states, determine earliest queued, earliest start_date and latest end_date). \n\nBy separting runs from the task structure we can add pagination and filtering to the`dag_runs_with_task_summaries` endpoint, then we can do stuff like only refresh on active dag runs.

I was wondering how `test_operator_expand_deserialized_unmap` was working prior and I see that `BaseOperator.__eq__` only compares against a certain subset of attributes, thus using that in the assertion for this test is not valid.

Hey @pierrejeambrun, I need your help on AIP-81 if you have time. It is related to new set endpoints in FastAPI.\n\n**&TLDR**\nThis is part of AIP-81. The aim is to use these endpoints from CLI. There are missing ones and one set of missing ones are these. I would like to get your help on reviews and your take on this before implementing because impacting more than one model and multiple endpoint in FastAPI. \n\nI created these issues as file but I am not sure if we should accept files as an input in the API since they are harder to validate if the file is safe in APIs and brought more security concerns. I am thinking we can create `POST` endpoints that accept the models in bulks like `post_connections` endpoint and parse the `files` in CLI before sending and receiving request/response from API. What do you think?\n\nMany thanks!

Not just secret values, it is also important that bootstrap variables for secrets manager configuration like `AIRFLOW__SECRETS__BACKEND_KWARGS` can be masked in task logs, since they are visible to the workers.

I am not sure this is what we want? The code you moved to the fab provider is code related to the old (current) UI, this code should be removed at some point but it should not be moved to the fab provider? Once the UI is complete (or close to be completed), we will be able to remove this code but, as per my understanding, we did no want to keep this code.

Random thought: Maybe we move this tracemalloc behavior into sigusr1? Just seems like maybe having a debug dump like we do today in sigusr2 and keeping performance impacts to stuff in sigusr1 might be a better approach.
