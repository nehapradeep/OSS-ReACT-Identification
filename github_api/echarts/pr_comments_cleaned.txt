Why is the suggested workaround (splitting the dataset) unacceptable?

> Why is the suggested workaround (splitting the dataset) unacceptable?\r\n\r\nIt requires huge refactoring (tooltip, axis. series and so on) and maintaining two implementations.\r\nAnd the splitted datasets may cause other limitations or bugs.\r\nAs a workaround for now, I added the same visualmap for each series and only show the first controller.\r\nWhen selection changes, use `setOption` to sync the state cross all visualMaps.\r\nBut the `hoverLink` interaction cannot be synced.

Any progress on this PR?

One month later, anyone can help?

Did I miss something?

Does the code need any changes?

I think this should be a great feature to introduce in ECharts 6.0. Please let me know if you need further help on this. I will check this PR regularly in case I miss anything more. Thanks!

Should this be called `indicatorIndex` instead of `dimensionIndex`?

Was this problemed solved by setting [custom.clip](https://echarts.apache.org/zh/option.html#series-custom.clip) to be true, which has been supported since v5.5.0 in #19197 ?

> Was this problemed solved by setting [custom.clip](https://echarts.apache.org/zh/option.html#series-custom.clip) to be true, which has been supported since v5.5.0 in #19197 ?\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the update records of ECharts version 5.5.0, the custom.clip attribute was indeed introduced to support clipping for custom series. My PR also addresses the y-axis adaptation issue, ensuring that when using pictorial bar charts, the y-axis can correctly adapt to the chart content and prevent the bar charts from being offset. This is consistent with the solution described in issue #19197 that you mentioned. Thank you for the reminder.

\r\n\r\nCurious about why tslib 2.3.0 doesn\

Some memos:\r\n\r\n+ Found that at present echarts only uses `__extends` function of tslib. (by searching `from "tslib` in echarts/lib.).\r\n+ About bundle size: After tree shaking (tested in vite@6.0.0-beta.9, `tsc -b && vite build`), only used functions of tslib will be included in bundle. That is only `__extends` (and `extendStatics`, which is called by `__extends` internally) is included. So the bundle size is probably not a concern till now.\r\n+ Compatibility if changing to `"tslib": "^x.x.x"`: Checked the commit log of `__extends` on git, there\

Any news about this ? We have to migrate our project to vue 3 and nodeNext but we are blocked with echarts and this feature....

> Any news about this ? We have to migrate our project to vue 3 and nodeNext but we are blocked with echarts and this feature....\n\nNope,without anyone review this simple pr.\n\nYou could fork and changg code then publish your own package,otherwise there is no exact time.üòì

For a more easy way,change the echarts dependency to a file path such as `lib/echarts`,in which way I use to test this pr if it works well.

@BTMuli It works but with that solution we lost types :(

Thank you for reviewing!\r\n\r\nI see the problem. and i found a new problem.\r\n\r\nIf every one tick in intervalList is true. the last one will be out of control.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45cff5fe-21d6-45e3-843f-fca5b67509fb)\r\n\r\nThe new fix way is change tick to right position and add last one after intervalList.\r\n\r\nSee the result after fix.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/921a8c25-5035-49be-bcca-d9c6f93e1b24)\r\n

The current logic is simple: add last one after intervalList.\r\n\r\nTo form a tick pair, similar to the effect of boundaryGap: true, add an ending tick to the intervalList.\r\n\r\nA potential issue arises if the intervalList is [true, false]. By adding an end tick, it becomes [true, true], which might seem odd.\r\n\r\nA more intelligent way is if the tick is end of axis then add it. if not ignore it. \r\n\r\nShould we use this?\r\n
