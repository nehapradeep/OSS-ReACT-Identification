I have referred to the official license requirements at https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/zh-cn/docs/3.2.2/contribute/join/DS-License. It is necessary to add a description of the newly introduced third-party library in `tools/dependencies/known-dependencies.txt`, but it seems to conflict with https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/16838. What should I do now to comply with the requirements? @SbloodyS

@SbloodyS fixed.

Since we use a daemon thread to detect the worker group changed, so there will always exist delay, but this delay does have a serious effect. We can broadcast a worker group changed event to all masters once the api receive a worker group changed event.

> Apache emphasizes achieving consensus.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the current consensus does not require all people to reach an agreement, but only more than half. For more info you can take a look at https://github.com/apache/comdev-site/pull/189\r\n\r\n> If there are significant differences and we cannot be resolved in the short term, we may choose to temporarily shelve the proposal, allowing much more time for more information before re-discussing.\r\n\r\nLike I said, no one among the maintainers on the current community is willing to refactor this module. How to achieve this without anyone willing to take responsibility?\r\n\r\n> Considering this is a major decision, I suggest you send a vote email to the dev mailing list.\r\n\r\nI think issue and dev mail list have the same meaning on this issue. And all active PMC/Committer have been included in this issue.

At that time, there was no DSIP mechanism in place, and much of the communication took place during community meetings. The feature I’m referring to took 8-9 months to develop and implement. If this is not a major feature, I believe that statement would be inaccurate.

For proposal only, it seems inconsistency exists, although some of the PMCs in #16728 already agreed to remove it, David is right and he could challenge it and ask to vote in the dev mailing list. So maybe should vote in dev mail thread, And I think the vote result should be the **ONLY** result of this PR continue or not instead of personal emotions.\r\nI found out author @zixi0825 also voted +1 in https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/16728#issuecomment-2434073450, and @qingwli, who has maintained data quality for some time, voted -1 for removing it. \r\n\r\nAnd for this feature, I think it should better act as a plugin instead of a built-in function. Especially since it has many bugs and CVEs and not team member want to maintain it. So I personally would vote +1 for removing it. \r\n\r\nAnd BTW, the time cost for the feature development should not as a standard to measure the importance or not.

I think you miss the code of master-server .The task of other system sholud call other system in master-server .

> Is it adding UT, testing functions in the class?\r\n\r\nUT and these tests are different types of tests. You can find the corresponding examples in the following links.\r\n\r\n- [cluster-test](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/tree/dev/.github/workflows/cluster-test)\r\n- [api-test](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/tree/dev/dolphinscheduler-api-test)\r\n- [e2e](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/tree/dev/dolphinscheduler-e2e)

> I found that it has not reached a coverage rate of 60%. How can I increase coverage? Is it possible to increase arbitrarily?\r\n\r\nYes. You should add more UT.

> +1 Please add e2e test later\r\n\r\nokay, I will do it

@Radeity PTAL.

To to target specific issue from PR, we recommend use keyword fix: #issue_id or close: #issue_id or closes: #issue_id in your PR describe(not title, just desc). It would not only connect issue to PR but also close issue automatically when PR is be closed.
