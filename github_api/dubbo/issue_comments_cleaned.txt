Issue #15107: Labels: type/need-triage, component/need-triage
since ```nacos do not notify the latest data once Sub```, ```Sub``` before ```Get``` might solve this issue, at least alleviate the issue.\nif ```Sub``` before ```Get``` at client starting, \n1. if server status is offline yet, nacos will not notify when it get ```Sub```  request as the server status is not changed. but it will notify the client once the server status is changed to online  no matter ```Get``` empty instances or not.\n2. if  server status is already online,  ```Get``` after ```Sub``` will get server instances no matter nacos notification or not.\n\nby the way, adding retry mechanism when setting forbidden to false might be another solution.

I found the cause of the problem because dubbo3 uses the nacos registry. Dual registration mode will be used, resulting in both the http port and dubbo port on a microservice being registered with nacos. Therefore, when the spring gateway obtains nacos services, after Load Balancer, it will poll and invoke these two ports, and it will be found that each time succeeds and the other fails.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da4cef3f-438e-4dc9-9d9a-b741a3594be7)\r\n

Hello and thanks for the feedback. But this is not a bug, this is because the latest version of `dubbo-spi-extensions` has not been released yet, and the current version 3.3 has not integrated the redis extension. Our latest version is coming soon, so you can wait. If you need to use it urgently, you can manually compile and package the master branch of `dubbo-spi-extensions` and then use it.@eduosi

Do you want to start in IDEA？ then run provider and then consumer.If you want to run a jar, because the consumer and provider are packages and not modules, only one jar package will be generated. You can use the Maven Exec plugin pom.xml and use the corresponding command at startup.@zhangcunli
