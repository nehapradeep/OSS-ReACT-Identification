How do you set this token? It is not good practice to keep that in a yaml file.
Issue #13094: Labels: feature, enhancement
Issue #13093: Labels: backend, feature
Another option is, we determine this automatically through time range. This is a kind of trade off, the good part is, this is transparent for UI and query, but the experience of the query is different. Query cold data is much slower compared with warm/hot data.

To support this alarm in a proper way, we could include values of each metric for every time bucket, and the calculation result of MQE for every time bucket.\r\n\r\n@Fine0830 The configurations for alarm page could be linked to metrics name. We should show the value of alarm rule MQE values by default, and support to show each metric value by a selector. \r\n\r\nNote, about the metric like `successful rate`, its original value are not formatted, e.g. `9900 represents 99%`. Showing the original 900 is exactly what we expect. This could indicate why the configurations of MQE are not proper.

Issue #12643: Labels: feature
Just tried out https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/tag/1.24.0-rc.0 and the filter_state becomes empty always, according to\r\n\r\n\r\n> Peer metadata is now stored\r\n>     in `filter_state.downstream_peer` and `filter_state.upstream_peer` instead\r\n>     of `filter_state["wasm.downstream_peer"]` and\r\n>     `filter_state["wasm.upstream_peer"]`.\r\n\r\nit should have downstream_peer upstream_peer but not, after downgrading to 1.22, `filter_state["wasm.downstream_peer”]` and\r\n     `filter_state["wasm.upstream_peer”]`  appear again so it’s probably not an issue of my setup\r\n\r\n\r\n
