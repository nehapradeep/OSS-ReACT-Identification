In which PR we bump MSRV? I remember @Xuanwo suppose to hold on that the last time.

> for the one connection it will not, and its sqlite most of the case is one user\r\n\r\nHi, opendal has native support for `op.read_with(path).concurrent(8)`. 

Also the logo?

Thanks for the contribution !

I have enabled the CI, please try again.

Nodejs does have an `exists` API but deprecated: https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fsexistspath-callback\r\n\r\nMaybe we can add `access` API in the future.

will do this in this PR

Thank you @dqhl76 for the review.

Inviting @erickguan for a review.\r\n

And just search some of popular lua projects\nLike Kong and Skynet\nexists is better than is_exist\n\nhttps://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/spec/01-unit/03-conf_loader_spec.lua\n\nhttps://github.com/cloudwu/skynet/blob/master/lualib/skynet/db/redis.lua

copy that, and make sense closing this

> Interesting. As in markdown they should be the same.\r\n\r\nYes, but we have special handling for links like this to ensure they generate correctly outside of GitHub.

Thank you @tisonkun for the review.

Thank you @dqhl76 for the review.

i also fixed one unit test failing on my local machine, but looks like it is failing in ci. i will revert it later

Considering that we will be adding more arguments for the list, how about following the same pattern to add this? https://github.com/apache/opendal/pull/5664\r\n\r\n> It is a little bit tricky to add the unit test directly, given `fs` service it self does not support recursively list.\r\n\r\nfs should support `recursive` list since we have applied some wrapper for it

> fs should support recursive list since we have applied some wrapper for it\r\n\r\nwhich service should i use? do i need to verify the capability as well? i observed error when specify the `capability.list_with_recursive`. \r\n\r\ni will update the code later to align with the pr you provided. 

> which service should i use? do i need to verify the capability as well? i observed error when specify the `capability.list_with_recursive`.\r\n\r\nI remember that all services implementing `list` will automatically support `recursive`. I will double-check this later.

> I remember that all services implementing `list` will automatically support `recursive`. I will double-check this later.\r\n\r\nagain, i may be wrong, but looks like the option for fs list is not used. so i think there is no recursive supprot for fs\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/opendal/blob/a6b04789fed735104b9a080eb4d213dbae0c38d0/core/src/services/fs/backend.rs#L364

And it might be a breaking change, if merge doc things is needed I think

Hi， @yihong0618， the upstream fixed https://github.com/veeso/suppaftp/issues/100, maybe you wanna try upgrade suppaftp and test if everything works as expected?

> Hi， @yihong0618， the upstream fixed https://github.com/veeso/suppaftp/issues/100, maybe you wanna try upgrade suppaftp and test if everything works as expected?\n\nwill try this tonight

@Xuanwo \r\n\r\nChore the dep but the `futures-rustls` doc in README is wrong they did not chore it...

Note that pulling in aws-lc-rs which uses `cmake` may cause problem when cross compiling Python wheels.

cc @meteorgan, would you mind taking a look at this PR? :)

Hi, this PR\

Thank you @yihong0618 for highlighting this.

@Xuanwo  so now with this API in place if i want to copy a file from local fs to s3 in near zero copy manner, how will a sample code look?\r\n\r\nbecause using `tokio::io::copy` or `futures::io::copy` will require AsyncRead and AsyncWrite inplementations.

> @Xuanwo so now with this API in place if i want to copy a file from local fs to s3 in near zero copy manner, how will a sample code look?\r\n\r\nHi, we can use [`SinkExt::send_all`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/prelude/sink/trait.SinkExt.html#method.send_all) to send stream into the sink in this way:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut osink = op.writer(path).await?.into_sink();\r\nlet mut ostream = op.reader(path).await?.into_stream(..).await?;\r\nosink.send_all(&mut ostream).await?;\r\nosink.close().await?;\r\n```

@Xuanwo BufferStream is still not completely public, probably needs to be added to exports.\r\n\r\n`pub(crate) use buffer_stream::BufferStream;`

> @Xuanwo BufferStream is still not completely public, probably needs to be added to exports.\r\n> \r\n> `pub(crate) use buffer_stream::BufferStream;`\r\n\r\nFixed in https://github.com/apache/opendal/pull/5730

You are welcome!

Thank you @dqhl76 for the review.

Do we have a ticket on INFRA or mailing list for the background?\r\n\r\nI suppose the INFRA team or privacy@apache.org would have some inputs.

if you want to reintroduce the images perhaps you could put them in https://github.com/apache/opendal/tree/main/website/static/img or similar

Hi, @meteorgan, you are now an OpenDAL committer and can submit PRs directly from the remote `apache` repository. This allows all your commits to be tested against our real services.

Hi, all opendal pmc members, please help review this post.

Thank you @tisonkun and @xyjixyjixyji for the review.

I also started a discussion about the issue I encountered in this PR: https://github.com/apache/opendal/discussions/5674

Hi, @geruh, this PR is almost ready to go. We are waiting for a fix on main branch to bring our CI back.

Thank you @messense for the review.

We should need an upgrade note for this somehow breaking/notable change.

> We should need an upgrade note for this somehow breaking/notable change.\r\n\r\nYes!

BTW, I think we can close #4896 once we merge this PR.

Thank you @dqhl76 for the review.

Thank you @meteorgan for the review!

~~currently only `minio_s3` failed, idk the reason.~~ fixed.\r\n

ok, I find the problem.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/opendal/blob/7455995092c697863ab6d326b962b8543756c0ca/core/src/layers/blocking.rs#L216\r\n\r\nthe origin crate use `&str` so\r\n\r\n1. change the whole crate to use `AsRef<Path>`, too many changes.\r\n2. do the type change on python binding, I prefer this.\r\n

Thank you @asukaminato0721 for this great work! Would you like to add some tests to the python code to ensure it works as expected?

@Xuanwo added

Do I need to add some other tests? So far I have tested this with my own program and `stat` and `write` work as expected

> Do I need to add some other tests? So far I have tested this with my own program and `stat` and `write` work as expected\r\n\r\nWe have integration tests for gcs, so it should fine as is.

Okay, I tested `presign` without `predefinedAcl`, and now it works. That problem should be addressed in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion this PR is ready to be merged

Sorry, opened by mistake

@Xuanwo CI passed. PTAL

I only ported part of the apis so the test can pass. And currently all result is using unwrap (as a first version).\r\n

Thank you so much, @asukaminato0721, for working on this. I will start reviewing this PR later next week. Wishing you a wonderful holiday in the meantime!

@Xuanwo now it\

Hi, @asukaminato0721 would you like to create a tracking issue for the following tasks? I think we need examples, tests, docs and figure how to release it.

Looks like korandoru/hawkeye is up-to-date now, so this is no longer needed.

@Xuanwo can you plz review this PR?

Need a new release tool to update versions based on a centralized file.

Perhaps we should introduce `write_has_content_type` flags to indicate which metadata is available in the meta returned by the write operation. Checking the `meta.content_type()` may pass the test but is meaningless to users; it could also potentially conceal incorrect implementations that developers can simplely return `Metadata::default()` to pass all tests. And it makes it more difficult for us to determine the implementation status of various services.

> No. The issue is that I compare the Etag from `stat` with the one from `write` in the tests to ensure we get the correct Etag if it\

Hi, @Xuanwo Would you mind taking some time to review this PR at your convenience? since it involves a lot of files, it may become difficult to merge if it takes too long.

> Provide a helpful error message if users attempt to call if_none_match("*") on a service that supports write_with_if_not_exists but not write_with_if_none_match. In this scenario, the error should suggest that users switch to using if_not_exists instead.\r\n\r\nMakes sense, I\

> This is a bit awkward but I suppose the config class is relatively stable.\r\n\r\nThis is fine as a starting point. However, in the near future, we will run `just generate` in CI to ensure there are no external changes to those files. Is the Javadoc requirement optional? Will it work if we only run `just generate java && ./mvnw spotless:apply`? 

Not exactly. But I can help in make a reasonable stable version at that time.

Does the Memcached service require any special configuration?

Thank you @PsiACE for the review!

Hi, @trim21, sorry for force-pushing my changes. I find it much easier to do this rather than trying to resolve the conflicts.

Hi, please work on https://github.com/apache/opendal/pull/5442 instead to ensure our reviewers are aware of the full history of this contribution. \r\n\r\nThis is the third time I am repeating: do not submit new PRs for the same contribution. Please ask questions in the comments of the PR if you encounter any issues while doing so.

> How to use this file?\r\n\r\nUpdated the `dev/README.md` files.

For me, the PR mostly LGTM, but some idea\r\n\r\n1.  We need to think more about `_int` type, a str type but with integer semantic\r\n2.  If we can drop support for the version under 3.12, we may can use typedict for kwargs, FYI https://peps.python.org/pep-0692/

I guess rust code is fine for now? Still need to resolve what kind of typing we want to generate.

Hi, @trim21 this will be large task, would you like to create a tracking issue for the progress?

Also cc @trim21 to take a look. I left the python part empty for you.

Oh right, I missed the `exception_module.add` part.

Thanks!

Hi, I like this direction. I believe we can integrate it into our workflow more effectively. Let me give it a try.

I think we should generate some kind of ir and generate types for each languages from ir

Thank you @ho-229 for the fix. The only thing left is the failing clippy check: https://github.com/apache/opendal/actions/runs/12337198169/job/34430608724?pr=5416

cc @ho-229 @Xuanwo. I think this would be a release blocker

@ho-229 the test still fail on windows， do you have any ideas?

It seems like the behavior of Cloud Filter API has changed, I am trying to figure it out.

Fix #5416 

> It seems like the behavior of Cloud Filter API has changed, I am trying to figure it out.\r\n\r\nThanks! I will release 0.51.0-rc.2 after your fix

> > I support temporarily adding only shared capability.\r\n> \r\n> Would you like to add this capability? I believe we can include them in the next 0.51 release.\r\n\r\nI can add it.\r\n\r\nPlease note that `shared` only indicates shared between processes but not shared between threads, it may be a little confusing if we will add backends which only support single-thread later.\r\n\r\nHowever, I guess we will not support that in a while.

Will test another PR use the CI flow, just ignore it.

Thank you @palash25 for fixing this. I will invite @PragmaTwice to take a review.

Funny to see it succeeded on redis but failed on redis cluster and kvrocks.

Fixed.

Nice work!\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd3a726b-70f8-42b6-9b6c-5d7e1da47782)\r\n\r\n

@LYZJU2019 any updates on this?

Updates are underway. Stay tuned!

> Updates are underway. Stay tuned!\r\n\r\nHi, perhaps we can divide this work into parts so that community members can participate as well. Considering our recent changes, this PR is almost deprecated, so we need a new one.\r\n\r\nMaybe we (@LYZJU2019 and @Eason0729) can discuss the detailed tasks in https://github.com/apache/opendal/issues/2442 and collaborate together?

I have outlined some brief ideas regarding the tasks we need to complete. Feel free to join the discussion: https://github.com/apache/opendal/issues/2442#issuecomment-2708017211

Hi, @koushiro, there are some conflicts preventing us from merging this PR. Could you take a look?

This is a breaking change, we will need to wait for https://github.com/apache/opendal/discussions/5257

Yeah, we can reopen this PR when we need it

I think we can close this PR for now and reopen it when MSRV is upgraded to 1.80

I did some experimentation ([patch](https://gist.github.com/erickguan/80bbf2ea82a10c69d260c53f0dd2f97b)) with async support for listing operations, which helps reduce runtime as expected. However, extending `OpList `introduces a "breaking" change. Since OpenDAL has a compatibility package, I’m happy to coordinate with you when you\

Thanks for tentative checking in with metakey!

After a closer look, can I pause this PR until your metakey work?

> After a closer look, can I pause this PR until your metakey work?\r\n\r\nYes, after the metakey is refactored, our work here will be much cleaner.\r\n

> Yes, after the metakey is refactored, our work here will be much cleaner.\r\n\r\nHi, you can continue your work now.

Not sure if we test services mysql against bindings and how we add such tests.

> Not sure if we test services mysql against bindings and how we add such tests.\r\n\r\nThey are always tested but not released because Linux x86_64 consistently works correctly, whereas other platforms do not.

Thank you @dqhl76 for the review!

Thank you @dqhl76 for the quick review! I will merge this PR after the release workflow finished.

Thank you @oowl for the quick review! I will merge this PR while CI all green.

There are some critical bug fixes that need to be released. I will merge this after we create a new release.

Thank you @PsiACE for the review!

Inviting @silver-ymz and @xyjixyjixyji to take another look.

CC @yuchanns, please review [`8071f91` (#5185)](https://github.com/apache/opendal/pull/5185/commits/8071f913abc5edde41039b99b7aae190ad5f428f) and let me know if it looks good to you.

LGTM on green

My CI/CD test: https://github.com/kassane/opendal/actions/runs/11391182857\r\n\r\nshow\r\n```bash\r\nwarning: use of deprecated method `opendal::BlockingOperator::is_exist`: rename to `exists` for consistence with `std::fs::exists`\r\n   --> src/operator.rs:530:22\r\n    |\r\n530 |     match op.deref().is_exist(path) {\r\n    |                      ^^^^^^^^\r\n    |\r\n    = note: `#[warn(deprecated)]` on by default\r\n```\r\n\r\nfixed in https://github.com/apache/opendal/pull/5198 ? (No, cpp-binding only)

Rebased, single commit!

Thank you @dqhl76 for the quick review!

Thank you @George-Miao for the review!

Wow, thank you @XmchxUp a lot for this!

@yuchanns now compile can work but test failed. Please see https://github.com/apache/opendal/actions/runs/11230441983/job/31217839150.

@yuchanns I fixed the go cases now.

Oops! The rebase overwrites your real commits. Sorry.\r\n\r\nSince #5179 has been merged, the go-binding can now be easily debugged. See https://github.com/apache/opendal/tree/main/bindings/go#development\r\n\r\nAnd I will debug the go part in this PR

The Go binding CI is green now. @tisonkun 

the change in readme: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/21594/13040423>\r\n

Fair enough to move forward in my opinion.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? @Xuanwo @yuchanns @xyjixyjixyji 

> Does it make a difference in understanding or performance in a public API on the C side?\r\n\r\nno.\r\n\r\nTuple style is just a syntax sugar that has `0` instead of `inner` as a field.\r\n

So we may suspend this request and perhaps review it again before we build the release process for the C binding.

IMO `inner` name provides better semantics when developers are reading the actual header files.

Closed due to discussions above. I am open to reopen this if someone favors this approach and illustrate reasons.

This is ready to be reviewed, cc @Xuanwo @PsiACE , I also fixed the bug in Go bindings\r\n\r\n

It makes main branch tests continue to fail, Thanks, merged 

@Xuanwo @tisonkun PTAL

@Xuanwo @tisonkun PTAL, thanks :)

I think Serializer cannot be demonstrated independently at the moment as it works in conjunction with the operations. It is used for serializing any class (by default, we use Jackson Databind). Here’s an example of how it can be used:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class ExampleEntity {\r\n    private String id;\r\n    private String name;\r\n\r\n    // Getters and setters\r\n    public String getId() {\r\n        return id;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setId(String id) {\r\n        this.id = id;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getName() {\r\n        return name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setName(String name) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen Opertions can be applied by \r\n```java\r\nOpenDALOpertions<ExampleEntity> ops = openDALTemplate.opsForMeasurement(\r\n                ExampleEntity.class);\r\n```\r\nThen he can do opendal options by this ops handle/

Thanks a lot for your review!\r\n\r\n> Thanks for your work! The code LGTM. However, I am not sure if the failed test related with this PR because it has so many lines of log information, it makes me hard to find the specific failed test 😢.\r\n\r\n- Aliyun Drive and Google Drive are unstable; this is a known issue. \r\n- I will try to make the logs less verbose.\r\n

why is there no `#` before `use opendal::Operator;` at line 127 ? is a mistake or intentional ? do we have any guidelines for this ?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/opendal/blob/d479ac39efa9a88e10448ad81e47292b3b4ed688/core/src/types/operator/operator.rs#L122-L133

> It mostly looks good to me. To make this feature work, we should also add a flag in `Capability` called `write_with_if_none_match`. Additionally, we can add a behavior test based on this.\r\n\r\n Thank you very much for your careful help. I have revised all your comments. 😄 

`if_none_match` also supported by gcs and azblob, would you like to implement them too? cc @ForestLH 

@Xuanwo After a quick search I found many occurrences of this pattern.\r\nWould you be open to a PR with that many changes?

Hi, @suyanhanx, thanks a lot for your review!

Hi, @GG2002. It might take us a while to complete the communication. Would you like to split this PR into parts so we can merge some of them first? I believe we can add the builder, config first without introduce the client impl in.

Thank you @dqhl76 for the quick review, love you!

Thanks a lot for the quick review @oowl!

Thank you @George-Miao for the quick review!

2. Because `list` and `list with version` use different APIs in S3, should we add new Github actions for S3, such as `aws_s3_with_version` ？ if we only use a bucket with object versioning enabled to test all cases, we might unintentionally skip the tests for `ListObjectsV2`

> [tracker.ceph.com/issues/68055](https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/68055) (The Issues of Ceph repository is not enabled)\r\n\r\nWe can create an issue on the OpenDAL side to keep track of it.

Thank you @oowl for the review!

The fail CI should be addressed by https://github.com/apache/opendal/pull/5102

Because of the design of the [metrics](https://docs.rs/metrics/latest/metrics/), we cannot do following things at the API level of the metrics library\r\n1. specify the buckets of the histogram metrics\r\n3. specify labels while modifying the metrics

Thank you very much for your work! I have noticed that Monoio performs well on single reads but not as effectively on concurrent ones. Could this be related to our thread-per-core design? Are there any plans to improve it?

Also, PositionWrite is not implemented for monoiofs.

@Xuanwo maybe you can also take a look at this PR?

While it comes to the step `Build C Binding`, you will need to modify the dynamic suffix too:\r\n```yaml\r\n      - name: Build C Binding\r\n        working-directory: bindings/c\r\n        env:\r\n          VERSION: "latest"\r\n          SERVICE: ${{ matrix.service }}\r\n          TARGET: ${{ matrix.build.target }}\r\n          CC: ${{ matrix.build.cc }}\r\n          OS: ${{ matrix.build.os }}\r\n        run: |\r\n          cargo build --target $TARGET  --release\r\n          DIR=$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/libopendal_c_${VERSION}_${SERVICE}_$TARGET\r\n          mkdir $DIR\r\n          if [ ${OS} == \

@yuchanns Thanks, I will test it in my Windows Computer :)

Hi, @koushiro. Would you like to continue this work and migrate it to the `MetricsLayer` and `PrometheusLayer` as well?\r\n\r\nI believe we can address the existing problems at the same time.

Hi, @Koushiro, thanks a lot for the metrics related PRs. I will review them today.

looks good to me, thanks :+1:

Hi, @koushiro, I demonstrated my idea at https://github.com/apache/opendal/pull/5064. Do you like it?

Ok.

@Xuanwo maybe you could review this PR first?

This PR makes think if we can reuse similar code in `prometheus` / `prometheus_client` / `metrics` layer.

Thanks a lot for this PR. I will merge this once we are ready for 0.50 release.

@Xuanwo is there a plan for the next release?

The service failure is not related.

it is just simple optional macro

fine

Maybe should define a helper macro to reduce `root` related code since most of services need to configure `root`.

The docs of `fn root` is not aligned, too. But it seems the behavior is always use `"/"` as default root if possible.

> Overall, this idea looks good to me. However, placing it in `services/mod.rs` might be difficult to maintain.\r\n> \r\n> Do you think it would be better to have `s3_config.rs`?\r\n\r\nI move them to `core/services/config.rs`, not `mod.rs`.\r\n\r\nEach struct is tidy and no more extension can be added. So split to many files (`core/services/config/s3.rs` in this case) seems only extra burden without certain benefits.

@tisonkun I think I had addressed your comments, PTAL again, thanks :)

We may not randomly mark `fn new` as `const fn` just because it can be. This is a one-way door that revoke the `const` modifier would be a breaking change.\r\n\r\nPlease explain why those `fn` SHOULD BE constant function.

Hi, @adriencaccia, OpenDAL has a benchmark suite that can run tests over different services based on the environment. Does Codspeed support our case? For example, running Cargo Codspeed multiple times can display their performance in groups based on service.

For example, running Cargo Codspeed multiple times can display their performance in groups based on service.\r\n\r\nHey, at the moment there is no support for grouping benchmarks.\r\nWhat I would recommend in the meantime, if relevant, is to manually change the name of the benchmarks depending on the service.\r\nFor example, for a benchmark `myBench` in the codebase, you could make its name depending on the service, so that multiple benchmarks are tracked on CodSpeed: `service1-myBench`, `service2-myBench`, `service3-myBench`...

> 2\\. As for `opendal-spring-starter` or `opendal-spring-data-starter`, I believe the `data` part is unnecessary. Spring Data is a sub-project of Spring, and we currently do not have that kind of relationship.\r\n\r\nHi, it looks good to me to remove `data`, but `boot` should still be kept? My current understanding is there is no `spring-starter` but `spring-boot-starter`.

Yes. Let me push a follow up and merge this.

@Xuanwo Sorry, It was a typo, `boot` is in the code indeedly.

should we add a test case which checks the root path for all services ? @Xuanwo 

> should we add a test case which checks the root path for all services ? @Xuanwo\r\n\r\nThere is no requirement for all services to support root; I believe we can add it on a case-by-case basis.

Can we use Github Secrets instead?

> Can we use Github Secrets instead?\r\n\r\nNo differences for that.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHow about use `schedule` with `cron` in `opendal-go-services` instead? We can pull opendal tags every five mintues, and build if new tags happend.

The part about releasing services has been moved to https://github.com/apache/opendal-go-services/pull/9.

Hello @Xuanwo and @oowl, PTAL.

We need to set up a new Windows action environment to run a Windows test for the new `cloudfilter` fs test. Besides, https://github.com/ho-229/cloud-filter-rs seems does not have any test. Maybe we need to complete integration or unit tests  first.

Hello @oowl, I have been add some tests for <https://github.com/ho-229/cloud-filter-rs>, and I think maybe we can add tests for `integration/cloudfilter` in next PR.

Hi @Xuanwo and @oowl , we have completed the improvements in `integrations/cloudfilter`. Should we proceed?

It seems the `cloudfilter` repo has some basic tests for reading and writing, but we all know the file system test case is so complex, That it is not enough. But can we try to merge the current PR first? what do you think? @Xuanwo 

> It seems the `cloudfilter` repo has some basic tests for reading and writing, but we all know the file system test case is so complex, That it is not enough. But can we try to merge the current PR first? what do you think? @Xuanwo \n\nMakes sense to me. We can move forward.

Hi @oowl , I think `cloudfilter` is not a filesystem, we are currently focusing on reading files from remote.

All failed test are not related.

All unit tests and doc tests are passed locally, I suggest we can merge this PR first.

It seems the swift tests steadily failed. I should not touch the logics around. Perhaps test set up are brittle.\r\n\r\n@Xuanwo do you know who write this service integrations?

Seems the root gets override. This is the code difference. Let me look at the test code.

Cause found. Fixed.

@Xuanwo Actually this is not a breaking change .. What parts are breaking?

> @Xuanwo Actually this is not a breaking change .. What parts are breaking?\n\nBuilder is a public trait. All users implement this API will fail to compile.\n\nAdding a new associated type and required function are breaking changes.

One question: using `Arc<T>` will cause heap allocation, we can store the `OperatorInfo` just in the `Operator` without wrapping in `Arc<T>`, but the size of `Operator` will be huge(300B), which is better?

Hello @Xuanwo, PTAL :)

Thank you for the test!

It looks good on #4767  tests. While AliyunDrive severely restricts concurrency access per account. Core-Test, Binding-Python, and Binding-Java consist of three parallel on one account leads to many retries.

May we note this in the README?

@Xuanwo @waynexia I wonder if we need to release a 0.47.1 for this fix.\r\n\r\n@waynexia Or we can work around this issue temporary in downstream like GreptimeDB?

A huge difference is that OpRead initiate a default range, which is previously `0..` but now `0..0`.

Drop for now.

The pr type can be "test".

I prefer repeating in hand rather than introducing a macro. \n\nThe ideal solution will be using `Range<u64>` or `offset, size` directly in `OpRead`. But this could be another breaking change. May be we can implement this change in next release?\n\n---\n\nOr we could change BytesRange to (offset, size) directly. All usage of BytesRange must have size now.

Good to know. Let me make another PR later.

I feel like the implemention has some bug to address.

I rewrite the lister (without getting file details), and LGTM on green. Previously, the `test-check` would list items while other threads delete things, leading to the random 404 files not found.

Trying to use this in production but this implementation is too different from that of OneDrive and Google Drive.\r\n\r\nThe major question is that: Why this OpenDAL implement requires refresh_token and client_id?\r\n\r\nThe AliyunDrive API supports OAuth. IMHO, we can just send an access_token to the operator and let the host app handle the auth part.\r\n\r\nNot all users would have the refresh_token.

Cool. That change makes sense.

Hi, since you are an opendal committer, would you like to submit PRs from `apache` upstream? This can allow our behavior tests that requires secrets to run (like aws, azblob and gcs).

@Xuanwo Let’s merge it first? We need to wait some times to PR nix and fuse3 repo support Apple target.

I have run all tests by `pjdfstest`, There was a whole bunch of output logs and can not ignore some case tests for particular tests. Maybe we need to reconsider another test case. \r\n\r\n

Also invite @Sherlock-Holo to join the discussion.

Closing!

> Closing!\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your work!

This partially addresses #4384. It assumes that _all_ readable services support seeking, which may not be valid, but it mirrors the implementation `seek`.

> It assumes that _all_ readable services support seeking\r\n\r\nCan you use https://docs.rs/opendal/latest/opendal/struct.Capability.html#structfield.read_can_seek?

This is an ongoing RFC related to this: https://github.com/apache/opendal/pull/4382

> Or is it just a blocker for this PR?\r\n\r\nAfter this RFC been implemented (which is already going on), we might need to change the way of implement `File` in python.

Hi, @mobiusklein, sorry for the long waiting. I feel like this PR is good to go. Would you like to fix the CI issues so we can get it merged?

> Is it correct to say that `seek` operations are now supported universally since the behavior is no longer described by the `Capability` type?\r\n\r\nYes!

Things appear to be all set now. Thank you.

Can we add the vectored methods like futures api? This will allow also enabling that capability, or do you want to take it as separate trait to implement like `ReadVectored`?

@Xuanwo think of it a typed Python script. Better than untyped toml strings..\r\n\r\nBut maybe I can port all these things into Python with Jinja template or sth.\r\n\r\nJust no untyped toml, we can write the schema in code.\r\n\r\nNewer Python can be typed also.

@Xuanwo finished to Python.

Follow up -\r\n\r\n* Tracking issues to convert other configs in this pattern.\r\n* Work on generate code for Java / Python / ...\r\n\r\ncc @Xuanwo @PsiACE 

Thanks!

cc @Xuanwo , can you rerun the workflows?

Sure, thank you for your contributions to open source 

Most LGTM! I will merge this PR after CI fixed: https://github.com/apache/opendal/pull/4369

> nits: we need update the docs here\r\n\r\nThanks for the notice. Will do.

Ooops, please running `npx license-checker --production --excludePrivatePackages --csv > DEPENDENCIES.node.csv` to update the dep list of our website.

done

Thank you!

Thank you!

Thanks!

Please solve the CI problem (`cargo fmt`) and expose config in `core/src/services/mod.rs` (you can take [this](https://github.com/apache/opendal/pull/4129/files#diff-fc66fc8ad9931e54e355edb5ea24f4cbfbfcaafc856ae66b0ce6d5029608532bR294-R295) as an example)\r\n

You can directly run cargo fmt under the core directory to format all files under it.\r\n\r\nBesides, you need to make clippy happy by fixing the warning emitted by `cargo clippy` 😀 

@Ji-Xinyou Done. All checks have passed. I was new to Rust so it took some time for me to understand cargo tool functionalities\r\n

I will add upgrade entries only the refactor is done.

Amazing!

Got this, I had a misunderstanding here before.

> The only remaining issue is how to enable features for C bindings 🤔\r\n\r\nMost of C binding users will write their own `Makefile`. We can define some envs and read them in `build.rs`, but it may need another PR to implement. Do you have interest?

main CI failed. Let me fix it

Oh, but memory service has very few code. Sounds better then.

There is a json deserialization error for ListOpResponse, I will try to fix it later.

It looks like running jfrog directly might fail on some tests, I will attempt to reconfigure jfrog later.

> It looks like running jfrog directly might fail on some tests, I will attempt to reconfigure jfrog later.\n\nIt could also be problems of opendal itself.

For example, jfrog returns `200` for rename success:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nUnexpected (persistent) at rename, context: { uri: http://127.0.0.1:8081/artifactory/example-repo-local/4b4169a6-08ff-40e1-907b-f07deccd5e67/b95cf5c9-e399-40a4-af59-20760ece910d, response: Parts { status: 200, version: HTTP/1.1, headers: {"x-jfrog-version": "Artifactory/7.77.5 77705900", "x-artifactory-id": "e44bf43451c1c186:-1fcda5a9:18de38a6cca:-8000", "x-artifactory-node-id": "062242c5aed1", "transfer-encoding": "chunked", "date": "Mon, 26 Feb 2024 03:53:58 GMT"} }, service: webdav, from: b95cf5c9-e399-40a4-af59-20760ece910d, to: e265191f-bca1-412e-9874-b824789e035a/8b0aa2ba-1d41-4782-9584-8eb83c286629/c819085a-672e-45ff-b426-67d77bd45627 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should allow it.

Ok, I found something really interesting...\r\n\r\nIn XML, content such as `&xxxx;` is considered escaped content and is treated specially. For example, `&` becomes `&amp;` and `"` becomes `&quot;`. The library `quick-xml` converts these escaped characters back into their original form during deserialization.\r\n\r\nHowever, we encountered a test case containing the sequence `&()_+-=;`, which quick-xml fails to recognize.

> Ok, I found something really interesting...\r\n\r\nI created an issue at upstream https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml/issues/719, we can workaround it first.

Thanks a lot for your help, it looks like things are working out!

Wait for secret.

Thanks!

Depends on https://github.com/apache/opendal/pull/4261

Why do we remove these suffixes? it seems the last PR has added these suffixes.  https://github.com/apache/opendal/pull/4246

I remember we have a consensus to add this suffix; when we decided to remove it?

> I remember we have a consensus to add this suffix; when we decided to remove it?\r\n\r\nThose suffix never exists in the releases (just in `Cargo.toml`). We can remove them now.

I mean: we decide to add them, and when we dedide to revert the previous decision?

Would you like to add a test for memcached with password? And do we need sasl at client side?

> Would you like to add a test for memcached with password? And do we need sasl at client side?\r\n\r\nYes, I will add it in another pr, we do not need sasl at client side.

To review the most important things of this PR, please using:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngit di main **/Cargo.toml **/package.json **/pom.xml\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the first time for us to try our new release pipeline, we will develop more tools to make it easier.

thanks

thanks!

Sharp eyes!

Looks like object_store is up-to-date now, so this is no longer needed.

Hi @Xuanwo thanks for review. I have updated the CI and tested it on my local enviroment. it seems that the set up process works as expected. But it is strange that the GitHub Action did not run this CI. Not sure what the reason is.

Aftering running the last command in CI, the system does not return a result for a very long period of time. I am wondering is there anything wrong in the CI workflow file?

> Aftering running the last command in CI, the system does not return a result for a very long period of time. I am wondering is there anything wrong in the CI workflow file?\r\n\r\nLet me check it out.

Hi, @ZhengLin-Li, thanks a lot for your work, I learnt a lot from this PR! Now I managed to setup the ceph rados services via `ceph/demo`.

Thanks！

Hi, @ArmandoZ, thanks for your efforts! Would you like to split them into two PRs for eaiser review and testing?

PR for hdfs test case over minio s3 is ready to review with test passed: #4184 \r\n\r\nFor azurite environment looks like [`hadoop-azure`](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/tree/12498b35bbb754225b0b2ca90d5ad4f5cf628d56/hadoop-tools/hadoop-azure) may not be able to support custom domains (other than *.blob.core.windows.net). Still looking into it

The remaining PR for azurite is also ready - #4185 . Seems to me this PR can be closed if no longer needed

Current behavior of AWS_ROLE_ARN envar for AWS CLI does currently only support WebIdentityToken roles (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html skip to AWS_ROLE_ARN)\r\n\r\nHowever role_arn from a config file does support normal assumable roles, so if we want to mimic AWS CLI behavior, it needs to be different between env and config loading.

But `source_credential` is already supported by reqsign?

Maybe we could handle like this:\r\nhttps://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/7fd4057baac5298fbf594980f618a57dd51b71ad/botocore/credentials.py#L1485

@Xuanwo is this one supported in reqsign and opendal upgrade to that version?

> @Xuanwo is this one supported in reqsign and opendal upgrade to that version?\n\nNot supported yet in reqsign. But anyway, it should be fixed in reqsign.

Please fix the CI.

Seems that the failed CI is not related to this PR, once `seafile`, and this time `webdav`, may be network issue?

> Seems that the failed CI is not related to this PR, once `seafile`, and this time `webdav`, may be network issue?\n\nYep. I think they are unrelated too. I will review this PR tomorrow.

Hi, @ho-229, would you like to share your plan about this PR? The size seems keep growing which makes it much harder for review.

Remove `frontend` folder and cleanup code

Does `jfrog-artifactory-oss` also provides webdav features? Maybe we can setup a new service to test webdav.

@Xuanwo, there is no info about this [here](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/using-webdav).\r\n\r\nAs I can see, they wrote if feature is available in the JFrog Artifactory Pro and higher, as it was written for S3 backend [here](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-installation-setup-documentation/s3-object-storage).

Thanks!

Hi @hoslo, congratulations on becoming a committer! You can now submit PRs by creating a branch directly in the apache/opendal repository, which will allow all CI checks to run automatically.

I did some work like this before.\nmostly the same as this PR\n. I think you need to add the auth things in Actions.\n\nwebdav acrions test use nginx as service, and nginx can use basic auth. plug-in\nBut kind of failed when I am trying , you can take a try.

And Actions you can use ftp actions as example

> Does anyone really set an empty password? IMO, even if the user wants to do so, the service provider will not allow it.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure that our implementation is **correct**. Whether or not a service supports basic authentication without a password is a user decision. For example, the user might have configured a webdav service with Nginx this way.

I have verified that `:` is necessary when it comes to empty password. Use [this](https://github.com/OpenMarshal/npm-WebDAV-Server) to build a local webdav server and set empty password, only if format the auth string with `:` can I connect to the local webdav server.

So nice!

There are still some details that need to be considered and clarified and may require further discussion. 

We plan to introduce a double-level cache logic like `memory + fs`, `memory + redis` which allows users to decide whether to fill cache in memory or fs. Thus we will take a look on this RFC later after the double level implemented.

Sounds good. And how about if we going one step further by totally remove `native-tls` and make `rustls` the default and the only option for TLS? Because `ureq` has no `openssl` support, naming a `native-tls` feature for half of fact is also quite confusing.

Great work!

Hi, @ArberSephirotheca \r\n\r\nI have set up integration tests in this PR in action `Service Test Ftp`. Can you take a look at the failed tests?\r\n\r\nSince you have been granted the `write` permission for this project, you can use `gh pr checkout 648` and push to this branch directly for testing.

All failures are sovled execpt one about `stat` operation. As there is no command in FTP that get information of single file/directory, I use `list` command for `stat` operation. `list` command works fine if we want information of a single file(it just return a vector of size 1). However, it does not work if we want to get information of a directory. For example, If we want to get metadata of a directory `throwawayaa/` it self, the `list`command would try to get metada of any files or subdirectory within that directory rather than itself.\r\nWe could solve it by first `list` its parent directory and then find the information of directory we want from vector of results, but what if user want the metadata of `/`(root directory)?

We can always return ObjectMode::DIR for root dir. Other metadata can leave as empty.

Thanks for your hard-working! We can release FTP support for the next release now!

There still exists a problem with FTP here. The correct way to shutdown a FTP connection is: \r\n1. Close the data stream. \r\n2. Wait for the `226 Transfer Ok` from command stream \r\n3. Send `Quit` command to the server.\r\n\r\nIf we want `read()` to directly return the data stream, we could not close the connection at the end of `Read` operation, and we must keep the connection open until user close data stream. Otherwise, we would receive unexpected response from server.(for example, if we send `Quit` command to server before closing the data stream, we would receive unexpected response such as `226 Transfer Complete` from server).

I created a new issue https://github.com/datafuselabs/opendal/issues/638 for that, maybe you will be interested to contintue.

I think all is done now, @Xuanwo thanks for your patience and instructions!

`build` op is used in fs Builder, but it is not a valid op.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n        if let Err(e) = std::fs::metadata(&root) {\r\n            if e.kind() == ErrorKind::NotFound {\r\n                std::fs::create_dir_all(&root).map_err(|e| parse_io_error(e, "build", &root))?;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow to fix this case?

I refactored error parse in #515 and #516, PTAL.

Please mark the conversation as resolved after fixing.

@Xuanwo PTAL! ;)

Please resolve conflicts before reviewing.

> For now, those functions are literally the same. The only difference between them is their visibility.\n\nMakes sense to me.\n\nService can implement their own error kind parser if needed.

I will add blocking APIs in `Accessor` directly after #502 is finished.\r\n\r\n> #502 will allow user to init a services without async.\r\n\r\nI expect users to use API in the way same as async code:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet bs = op.object("path/to/file").blocking_read();\r\n```\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet bs = op.object("path/to/file").read().await;\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI don\

Ok. this is just an experiment pr to validate.

@Xuanwo Thanks for merging! Could you please create a release for this?

Addressed in https://github.com/datafuselabs/opendal/pull/497

@xprazak2 Hi, are you still working on this PR?

I am still working on it, apologies it is taking me so long. I think I have addressed all the comments except for using `new_http_channel`, I might need a bit more guidance on it. I was looking at it previously, but I am not sure how to plug it in. I can use `Box::pin` to pass fut into `RequestWriter` and skip `IpfsWriterFuture` but then I get lifetime error:\r\n![io-channel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2664090/184530832-e60246e4-52f0-47c5-a752-4b4f1d60eea2.png)\r\n

We have a refactor in https://github.com/datafuselabs/opendal/pull/556 to make it easier to implement IPFS backend, PTAL.

Having access to the reader made it much easier to implement `write`. I rebased and removed IPFS SDK.

@Xuanwo, all green now.

Great, thanks for your PR!

@PsiACE Can you share the benchmarks after replacing `tokio-fs`?

Bravo!

Let me have a sleep to see will I change my mind tomorrow.

Update with main to fix a CI failure.

Thanks for the contribution!\r\n\r\nThis change mostly LGTM except one thing: can we make `serde` a feature so that we only derive those traits while needed?

@Xuanwo  Of course, we can. I have refactor the code and make `serde` as a feature(disabled by default), please take a look, thank you.\r\n\r\n

Thank you for a review and hints. The trailing slash turns out to be [surprisingly tricky](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ooh5wn/damn_trailing_slash/) as `std::path::Path` seems to be normalizing them away. Also, when there is a trailing `/` and I split by it, I cannot add it back and return `&str` due to ownership, so I return `String`. Is that ok?

Run `cargo fmt` to make our check happy :smile: 

Our test s3 bucket has been moved, waiting for @wubx to fix.

wow, uuid got a 1.0 release!

What I mean is remove the line `#[serde(rename = "Blob", default = "Vec::new")]`.\r\n\r\n- `blob` will be renamed to `Blob` via `PascalCase`, so we don\

Nice work!

AWS S3 and anonymous minio s3 works well, we need to address https://github.com/Xuanwo/reqsign/issues/20

Cool, I used to think memory backend is test only

Maybe we should use `Vec<Bytes>` to support multiple Bytes?

Nice work!

Thank you, @Xuanwo \r\nDo you have the plan to release a new version? Databend need this :)

Databend bumped:\r\nhttps://github.com/datafuselabs/databend/pull/4277/commits/b65fa3cd9f82e1a9d11b6804d5b1649b19d7e012\r\n\r\n@Xuanwo , Please have a look, thank you :)

Here is my PR: https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend/pull/4298

@BohuTANG This PR will make it possible to calculate the read cost inside the reader.\r\n\r\nAnd we are archiving it in a much better way: we can calculate the cost for pending, for reading. We can even calculate the averaging reading speed based on `ReadEvent::Read(n)`.

Oh, the size should take `offset` into consideration, let me fix it and add a test.

Ping @dantengsky @zhang2014 @sundy-li, I refactor this PR, please read RFC [limited-reader](https://github.com/datafuselabs/opendal/blob/fix-reader/docs/rfcs/0090-limited-reader.md) for more details.

Cool, I will bump the latest version in this PR:\r\nhttps://github.com/datafuselabs/databend/pull/4277

The test should be improved in the future, but I think this PR is an excellent start to make `ObjectStream` work on s3.

Great! much better than `GetBucketLocation` :D

Seems we should bump a new release for databend?

/lgtm\r\n\r\nWe should add unit tests for it(assume will be addressed in the later PR).\r\n

> /lgtm\r\n> \r\n> We should add unit tests for it(assume will be addressed in the later PR).\r\n\r\nYep, I have a plan to have them tested today.
