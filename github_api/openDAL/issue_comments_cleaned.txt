The remaining point to discuss is that `OpXxx` is currently in `opendal::raw`. If we want to expose it in the API, such as through `write_opt`, we first need to make it publicly available.

One problem I can see with oci artifacts is that each artifact itself is likely a directory of files (encapsulated as a tarball), so we really have two layers of "directories" here, the oci registry namespace/image/tag triplet, and the directory tree within a single artifact. For starters we might focus on the operations within a single artifact, yet you cannot implement efficient list operation on tarballs.

Hi @aoli-al, thanks so much for your bug report! I really enjoyed reading through https://aoli.al/blogs/chrome-bug/.\n\nOpenDAL checks the body size against the `Content-Length`, and I thought `206 Partial Content` should return the correct `Content-Length`. It simply includes a `Content-Range` header specifying the range of the returned content.\n\nI tested it locally and find that the server does return correct `content-length`:\n\n```shell\n:) curl \

I will invite @tisonkun and @G-XD to participate in the API design first. Are there any special considerations when adding more options to our write API? Is it complex to implement such support?\n\nIn rust side, we use conditional writes in the way like:\n\n```rust\nop.write_with(path).if_not_exists(true).await;\nop.write_with(path).if_none_match(etag).await;\n```\n\nOr passing it into a writer:\n\n```rust\nlet w = op.writer_with(path).if_not_exists(true).await;\nlet w = op.writer_with(path).if_none_match(etag).await;\n```\n\nThe links to API: https://docs.rs/opendal/latest/opendal/operator_futures/struct.OperatorFuture.html#method.if_not_exists-1

Hi, @Xuanwo , thank you very much for your suggestions. I think we can first list some common services that support checksum algorithms, which may include the supported checksum algorithms, the use of checksum algorithms in different read and write methods, the scope of data verification, etc. I would be happy to find and provide a list like this.\n\nIn addition, after choosing some common checksum algorithms, maybe these services will initially just rely on these common functions and expose them to users by setting configuration like we do now, and then consider refactoring this part by possibly adding layers; or perhaps from the beginning, the most general design considerations are used to determine the future application mode of checksum in OpenDAL, and implement it on this basis.\n\nI think the advantage of the first approach is that we can implement checksum for the most commonly used services first and accumulate knowledge for future general designs in the process. The advantage of the second approach is that if we design it clearly from the beginning, we can avoid repeated implementation.\n\nThese are some of my simple ideas, and hope to get any suggestions. 💗
